	blank page after copyright spewage. [krb5-doc/54]

	* Makefile: Apply jik's changes for dependencies [krb5-doc/101]

	* install.texinfo (krb5.conf): Fixed extra
	closebrace. [krb5-doc/92]

Fri Oct 18 13:42:49 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* install.texinfo (Create a kadmind Keytab): use kadmin.local
 	instead of kadmin to perform pre-kadmind setup [krb5-admin/28]

Tue Sep 10 20:47:41 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* user-guide.texinfo: The telnet man page only has 9 pages; the
		rcp man page only has 1 page.

Mon Sep  9 19:35:37 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* build.texinfo: Updated to reflect latest OS inconsistencies;
 		removed shared library theory section to a new file,
 		implementor.texinfo, which will have information that only
 		developers will care about.

Mon Sep  9 13:25:06 1996  Jeff Bigler  <jcb@viola.cygnus.com>

	* texinfo-suppl.tex: extracted @doubleleftarrow{} hack into
	separate file so we don't have to ship a modified version of
	texinfo.tex.

	* user-guide.texinfo (Reference): changed offset to -700 for
	PostScript man pages for full page printing.

	* man2ps: changed scale from 0.7 to 0.85 for full page printing.
	Piped csplit output to /dev/null, to make it a bit neater.

Fri Sep  6 19:59:12 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* copyright.texinfo: Updated copyright dates and modify copyright
		text to have non-commital words about export licenses.

	* admin.texinfo, install.texinfo: Set edition to "b7-1".

	* user-guide.texinfo: Set edition to "b7-1".  Fix the hoffset and
 		voffsets for the included man page poscript files so that
 		the images are lined up correctly (at least using MIT's
 		dvips).

	* Makefile (user-guide): Make sure the kpasswd man page's
	 	postscript is built.  Add new target "clean-temp-ps" which
	 	cleans up the temporary postscript files.

	* man2ps: Changes to make man2ps more portable.  Remove bash
		specific constructs, and replace with calls to expr.
		Since the arguments to "troff" require groff, just try to
		run groff explicitly (someone can always edit the ROFF and
		ROFF_OPTIONS at the top of the script).  Try to
		automatically detect whether csplit or gcsplit should be
		used, by grovelling through the user's path.

	* texinfo.tex: Check in version of texinfo.tex that has Jeff's 
		magic doubleleft arrow hack.
