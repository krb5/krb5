these were the
		   Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.1

			    Release Notes
which will be updated before the next release by
			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in three gzipped tarfiles,
krb5-1.1.src.tar.gz, krb5-1.1.doc.tar.gz, and krb5-1.1.crypto.tar.gz.
The krb5-1.1.doc.tar.gz contains the doc/ directory and this README
file.  The krb5-1.1.src.tar.gz contains the src/ directory and this
README file, except for the crypto library sources, which are in
krb5-1.1.crypto.tar.gz.

Instruction on how to extract the entire distribution follow.  These
directions assume that you want to extract into a directory called
DIST.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.1.src.tar.gz
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.1.crypto.tar.gz
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.1.doc.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gzcat krb5-1.1.src.tar.gz | tar xpf -
	gzcat krb5-1.1.crypto.tar.gz | tar xpf -
	gzcat krb5-1.1.doc.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into DIST/krb5-1.1/src
and the documentation into DIST/krb5-1.1/doc.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install.ps; it contains the
notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Notes, Major Changes, and Known Bugs
------------------------------------

* Triple DES support is included; however, it is only usable for
  service keys at the moment, due to a large number of compatibility
  issues.  For example, the GSSAPI library has some (buggy) support
  for a triple DES session key, but it is intentionally disabled.
  ** Do not use triple-DES in your config files except as described in
  ** the documentation.

* The principal database now uses the btree backend of Berkeley DB.
  This should result in improved KDC performance.

* The lib/rpc tests do not appear to work under NetBSD-1.4, for
  reasons that are not completely clear at the moment, but probably
  have something to do with portmapper interfacing.  This should not
  affect other operations, such as kadmind operation.

* Shared library builds are under a new framework; at this point only
  Solaris (2.x), Irix (6.5), NetBSD (1.4 i386), and possibly Linux are
  known to work.  All other working shared library builds may be
  figments of your imagination.

* Many existing databases, especially those converted from krb4
  original databases, may contain expiration dates in 1999.  You
  should make sure to update these expiration dates, and also change
  any config file entries that have two-digit years.

* Hardware preauthentication is known to be broken; this will be fixed
  in an upcoming release.

* krb524d now defaults to forking into the background; use
  "krb524d -nofork" to avoid forking.

* Not all reported bugs have been fixed in this release, due to time
  constraints.  We are planning to make another release in the near
  future with more complete triple DES support, and additional
  bugfixes.  Many of the bugs in our database are reported against
  what is now quite old code, or require hardware that we do not have,
  which make them difficult to reproduce and debug.  We will work on
  these older bugs and some externally submitted patches for the
  following release.
