Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Please keep in mind that unencrypted e-mail is not secure. If you need
to report a security vulnerability, or send sensitive information,
please PGP-encrypt it to krbcore-security@mit.edu.

You may view bug reports by visiting

    http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/

and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".

DES transition
--------------

The krb5-1.8 release disables single-DES cryptosystems by default.  As
a result, you may need to add the libdefaults setting
"allow_weak_crypto = true" to communicate with existing Kerberos
infrastructures if they do not support stronger ciphers.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as weak.  The
krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites to migrate away
from using single-DES cryptosystems.  Among these is a configuration
variable that enables "weak" enctypes, which now defaults to "false"
beginning with krb5-1.8.  The krb5-1.8 release includes additional
measures to ease the transition away from single-DES.  These
additional measures include:

* enctype config enhancements (so you can do "DEFAULT +des", etc.)
* new API to allow applications (e.g. AFS) to explicitly reenable weak
  crypto
* easier kadmin history key changes

Major changes in 1.8.4
----------------------

This is primarily a bugfix release.

* Fix vulnerabilities:
  ** KDC uninitialized pointer crash [MITKRB5-SA-2010-006 CVE-2010-1322]
  ** kpropd denial of service [MITKRB5-SA-2011-001 CVE-2010-4022]
  ** KDC denial of service attacks [MITKRB5-SA-2011-002
     CVE-2011-0281 CVE-2011-0282 CVE-2011-0283]
  ** KDC double-free when PKINIT enabled [MITKRB5-SA-2011-003
     CVE-2011-0284]
  ** kadmind frees invalid pointer [MITKRB5-SA-2011-004 CVE-2011-0285]

* Interoperability:

  ** Correctly encrypt GSSAPI forwarded credentials using the session
     key, not a subkey.

  ** Set NT-SRV-INST on TGS principal names as expected by some
     Windows Server Domain Controllers.

  ** Don't reject AP-REQ messages if their PAC doesn't validate;
     suppress the PAC instead.

  ** Correctly validate HMAC-MD5 checksums that use DES keys

krb5-1.8.4 changes by ticket ID
-------------------------------

6701    syntax error in src/plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/kerberos.ldif
6764    has_mandatory_for_kdc_authdata checks only first authdata element
6768    GSSAPI forwarded credentials must be encrypted in session key

Major changes in 1.8.3
----------------------

* Behavior Change:

    GSS-API context expiration -- the gss_wrap and gss_unwrap
    functions no longer check for ticket expiration.  Applications
    wishing to enforce ticket lifetimes should check using the
    gss_inquire_context function.  The previous behavior of checking
    for ticket expiration produced results that were not expected by
    application developers, and could lead to poor user experience.

* Fix an interoperability issue when the Microsoft HMAC-MD5 checksum
  type was used with non-RC4 keys.

* Fix an interoperability issue with ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key
  exchange in PKINIT that would happen for less than 1% of
  transactions.

6750    krb5kdc doesn't parse the -P command-line option correctly
6751    Allow Microsoft HMAC-MD5 checksum types to use non-RC4 keys

Major changes in 1.8.2
----------------------

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Major changes in 1.8
--------------------

The krb5-1.8 release contains a large number of changes, featuring
improvements in the following broad areas:

* Code quality
* Developer experience
* Performance
* End-user experience
* Administrator experience
* Protocol evolution

Code quality:

* Move toward test-driven development -- new features have test code,
  or at least written testing procedures.

* Remove applications to a separate distribution to simplify
  independent maintenance.

* Increase conformance to coding style

  + "The great reindent"

  + Selective refactoring

Developer experience:

* Crypto modularity -- vendors can more easily substitute their own
  crypto implementations, which might be hardware-accelerated or
  validated to FIPS 140, for the builtin crypto implementation that
  has historically shipped as part of MIT Kerberos.  Currently, only
  an OpenSSL provider is included, but others are planned for the
  future.

* Move toward improved KDB interface

* Improved API for verifying and interrogating authorization data

Performance:

* Investigate and remedy repeatedly-reported performance bottlenecks.

* Encryption performance -- new crypto API with opaque key structures,
  to allow for optimizations such as caching of derived keys

End-user experience:

* Reduce DNS dependence by implementing an interface that allows
  client library to track whether a KDC supports service principal
  referrals.

Administrator experience:

* Disable DES by default -- this reduces security exposure from using
  an increasingly insecure cipher.

* More versatile crypto configuration, to simplify migration away from
  DES -- new configuration syntax to allow inclusion and exclusion of
  specific algorithms relative to a default set.

* Account lockout for repeated login failures -- mitigates online
  password guessing attacks, and helps with some enterprise regulatory
  compliance.

* Bridge layer to allow Heimdal HDB modules to act as KDB backend
  modules.  This provides a migration path from a Heimdal to an MIT
  KDC.

Protocol evolution:

* FAST enhancements -- preauthentication framework enhancements to
  allow a client to securely negotiate the use of FAST with a KDC of
  unknown capabilities.

* Microsoft Services for User (S4U) compatibility: S4U2Self, also
  known as "protocol transition", allows for service to ask a KDC for
  a ticket to themselves on behalf of a client authenticated via a
  different means; S4U2Proxy allows a service to ask a KDC for a
  ticket to another service on behalf of a client.

* Anonymous PKINIT -- allows the use of public-key cryptography to
  anonymously authenticate to a realm

* Support doing constrained delegation similar to Microsoft's
  S4U2Proxy without the use of the Windows PAC.  This functionality
  uses a protocol compatible with Heimdal.
