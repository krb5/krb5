		  Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.4.3

			    Release Notes
			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in a tarfile,
krb5-1.4.3-signed.tar.  The tarfile contains a gzipped tarfile,
krb5-1.4.3.tar.gz, and its corresponding PGP signature,
krb5-1.4.3.tar.gz.asc.

You will need the GNU gzip program, and preferably, the GNU tar
program, to extract the source distribution.

The distribution will extract into a subdirectory "krb5-1.4.3" of the
current directory.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Important notice regarding Kerberos 4 support
---------------------------------------------

In the past few years, several developments have shown the inadequacy
of the security of version 4 of the Kerberos protocol.  These
developments have led the MIT Kerberos Team to begin the process of
ending support for version 4 of the Kerberos protocol.  The plan
involves the eventual removal of Kerberos 4 support from the MIT
implementation of Kerberos.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has reached the end of its useful
life.  DES is the only encryption algorithm supported by Kerberos 4,
and the increasingly obvious inadequacy of DES motivates the
retirement of the Kerberos 4 protocol.  The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), which had previously certified DES as
a US government encryption standard, has officially announced[1] the
withdrawal of the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for
DES.

NIST's action reflects the long-held opinion of the cryptographic
community that DES has too small a key space to be secure.  Breaking
DES encryption by an exhaustive search of its key space is within the
means of some individuals, many companies, and all major governments.
Consequently, DES cannot be considered secure for any long-term keys,
particularly the ticket-granting key that is central to Kerberos.

Serious protocol flaws[2] have been found in Kerberos 4.  These flaws
permit attacks which require far less effort than an exhaustive search
of the DES key space.  These flaws make Kerberos 4 cross-realm
authentication an unacceptable security risk and raise serious
questions about the security of the entire Kerberos 4 protocol.

The known insecurity of DES, combined with the recently discovered
protocol flaws, make it extremely inadvisable to rely on the security
of version 4 of the Kerberos protocol.  These factors motivate the MIT
Kerberos Team to remove support for Kerberos version 4 from the MIT
implementation of Kerberos.

The process of ending Kerberos 4 support began with release 1.3 of MIT
Kerberos 5.  In release 1.3, the default run-time configuration of the
KDC disables support for version 4 of the Kerberos protocol.  Release
1.4 of MIT Kerberos continues to include Kerberos 4 support (also
disabled in the KDC with the default run-time configuration), but we
intend to completely remove Kerberos 4 support from some future
release of MIT Kerberos, possibly as early as the 1.5 release of MIT
Kerberos.

The MIT Kerberos Team has ended active development of Kerberos 4,
except for the eventual removal of all Kerberos 4 functionality.  We
will continue to provide critical security fixes for Kerberos 4, but
routine bug fixes and feature enhancements are at an end.

We recommend that any sites which have not already done so begin a
migration to Kerberos 5.  Kerberos 5 provides significant advantages
over Kerberos 4, including support for strong encryption,
extensibility, improved cross-vendor interoperability, and ongoing
development and enhancement.

If you have questions or issues regarding migration to Kerberos 5, we
recommend discussing them on the kerberos@mit.edu mailing list.

Acknowledgments
---------------

Appreciation Time!!!!  There are far too many people to try to thank
them all; many people have contributed to the development of Kerberos
V5.  This is only a partial listing....

Thanks to Kevin Coffman and the CITI group at the University of
Michigan for providing patches for implementing RPCSEC_GSS
authentication in the RPC library.

Thanks to Derrick Schommer for reporting multiple memory leaks.

Thanks to Quanah Gibson-Mount of Stanford University for helping
exercise the thread support code.

Thanks to Michael Tautschnig for reporting the heap buffer overflow in
the password history mechanism.  [MITKRB5-SA-2004-004]

Thanks to Wyllys Ingersoll for finding a buffer-size problem in the
RPCSEC_GSS implementation.

Thanks to iDEFENSE for bringing to our attention the vulnerabilities
in the telnet client.  [MITKRB5-SA-2005-001]

Thanks to the members of the Kerberos V5 development team at MIT, both
past and present: Danilo Almeida, Jeffrey Altman, Jay Berkenbilt,
Richard Basch, Mitch Berger, John Carr, Don Davis, Alexandra Ellwood,
Nancy Gilman, Matt Hancher, Sam Hartman, Paul Hill, Marc Horowitz, Eva
Jacobus, Miroslav Jurisic, Barry Jaspan, Geoffrey King, John Kohl,
Peter Litwack, Scott McGuire, Kevin Mitchell, Cliff Neuman, Paul Park,
Ezra Peisach, Chris Provenzano, Ken Raeburn, Jon Rochlis, Jeff
Schiller, Jen Selby, Brad Thompson, Harry Tsai, Ted Ts'o, Marshall
Vale, Tom Yu.

Very special thanks go to Marshall Vale, our departing team leader.
Over the past few years, Marshall has been extremely valuable to us as
mentor, advisor, manager, and friend.  Marshall's devotion as a
champion of Kerberos has helped our team immensely through many trials
and hardships.  We will miss him tremendously, and we wish him the
best in his future endeavors.
