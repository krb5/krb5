Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

You may view bug reports by visiting

http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/

and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".

DES transition
--------------

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as weak.  The
krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites to migrate away
from using single-DES cryptosystems.  Among these is a configuration
variable that enables "weak" enctypes, which defaults to "false"
beginning with krb5-1.8.

Major changes in 1.9
--------------------

Code quality:

* Python-based testing framework
* DAL cleanup

Developer experience:

* NSS crypto back end
* PRNG modularity
* Fortuna-like PRNG

Performance:

* Account lockout performance improvements

Administrator experience:

* Trace logging
* Plugin interface for password sync
* Plugin interface for password quality checks
* Configuration file validator
* KDC support for SecurID preauthentication

Protocol evolution:

* IAKERB
* Camellia encryption (experimental; disabled by default)
