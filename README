Now, with that out of the way, let me point you to a few things:

The file doc/HOW_TO_BUILD gives instructions on how to start build
Kerberos.  More complete building and installation instructions can be
found in the doc/install.texi.  (A postscript file is provided for
your convenience.)

The file doc/TREE-GRAPH is a graphical representation of the source
directory tree you should receive with this distribution.

The file doc/SOURCE-TREE describes what's in each directory.

Appreciation Time!!!!  There are far too many people to try to thank
them all; many people have contributed to the development of Kerberos
V5.  This is only a partial listing....  

Thanks to Mark Eichin at Cygnus for writing the new autoconf
configuration system, for making the code much more portable, and for
serving as pre-release testers.

Thanks to Marc Horowitz, Barry Jaspan, and Jonathan Kamens (and
others) at Openvision, Inc. for providing us with an GSS-API library,
for serving as pre-release testers, and for finding and fixing many
bugs.

Thanks to Cybersafe for providing patches to fix bugs with inter-realm
authentication.  

Thanks to Ari Medivnsky and Cliff Neuman for writing a ksu client.

Thanks to Jim Miller from Suite Software for contributing many detailed
bug reports, most of them by doing desk checks over the code!

Thanks to Prasad Upasani from ISI for porting the Berkeley
rlogin/rsh/rcp suite and for testing out our distribution on the Sun.

Thanks to Glenn Machin and Bill Wrahe from Sandia National Labs for
contributing the old kadmin server, plus lots of bugfixes.

Thanks to Bill Sommerfeld from HP for commenting on early Kerberos
interface drafts, suggesting improvements in later coding interfaces,
and finding and fixing many bugs.

Thanks to Paul Borman from Cray for writing the Kerberos v4 to v5 glue
layer and the Kerberos v5 subroutines for telnet.  

Thanks to Dan Bernstein, for providing the replay cache code.  

Thanks to the members of the Kerberos V5 development team at MIT, both
past and present: Richard Basch, Jay Berkenbilt, John Carr, Don Davis,
Nancy Gilman, Barry Jaspan, John Kohl, Cliff Neuman, Paul Park, Ezra 
Peisach, Chris Provenzano, Jon Rochlis, Jeff Schiller, Ted Ts'o, Tom Yu.
