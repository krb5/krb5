	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): If a default realm is specified
		(with -r), use krb5_set_default_realm so that created keys
		will have the correct realm.

Thu Mar 23 23:28:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kdb5_edit.c (show_principal, parse_princ_args): Add

	* dumpv4.c (v4_print_time): gmtime expects a pointer to a time_t,
		not a long. On most systems these are the same, on
		others.... 

Wed Nov 16 01:03:42 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* dumpv4.c: new file. New command dump_v4db which creates a v4
	slave dump out of a v5 database, leaving out any keys which aren't
	using v4 salt, and any keys that aren't for the current
	realm. Reencrypts using v4 master key, synthesizes arbitrary
	master key version number.
	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4 for dump support.
	* kdb5_ed_ct.ct: add new dump_v4 command.

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Don't let errors in
		set_dbname_help initially cause the exit status to be set.
		Commands like load_db don't need a valid database to be

		ss_execute_line doesn't set code to 0 if there are no
	problems. 

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Add a new option so that the
		master key password can be entered on the command line ---
		for testing only; not documented!!

		ctime().

	* tcl_wrapper.c (doquit):
	  ss_wrapper.c (main):
