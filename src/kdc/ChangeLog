		return_pdata() which is responsible for all padata info
		which is returned by the KDC in the KRB_AS_REP message.

	* network.c (setup_network):
	* main.c (initialize_realms): Massive revamp of how the network

		preauthentication routines.

	* do_as_req.c (process_as_req): Move preauthentication code to
		kdc_preauth.c, for better modularity.

	* do_as_req.c (prepare_error_as): Add new argument to this
		function so that the e_data field may be passed in and
		included in the KRB_ERROR messsage which is passed back to
		the user.

Mon Aug 21 17:03:53 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* main.c - Interpret -k and -e arguments as strings instead of string
		representations of integers (e.g. -e des-cbc-md5).

	* main.c - Save or generate per-realm key/salt list.  Use this list
		to determine which key to use from the list of server keys.

		response is issued.  Use krb5_dbe_find_keytype() to find the
		appropriate key in the list of keys.  Find appropriate client
		key instead of using the key in slot 0.  Fix gcc -Wall moans.
	* kdc_util.c - Use per-realm key/salt list to determine which key to
		use from the list of server keys.  Fix gcc -Wall complaints.
	* kerberos_v4.c - Use krb5_dbe_find_keytype() to find appropriate key.

	* kdc_util.c - Cast argument to fetch_asn1_field which caused a
		compiler moan.
	* kerberos_v4.c - Use KRB5_PROTOTYPE for v4_klog which is set correctly
		for the compiler.  Some compilers (e.g. OSF/1 native) understand
		prototypes even when not in STDC mode.
		Also use KRB5_MIT_DES_KEYSIZE instead of MIT_DES_KEYSIZE.


Thu Jul 27 02:59:05 1995 Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * do_as_req.c do_tgs_req.c kdc_util.c main.c : Use new kdb format.

		alt_prof.c because it's now used by admin and kadmin programs.
		Remove explicit stash file handling logic and supply stash
		file name to krb5_db_fetch_mkey() since it can now handle a
		non-default stash file name.

Thu Jul 13 19:51:33 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* main.c: Include netinet/in.h if we're using IP.

		locating per-realm data is [realms]->realm->tag.  Add
		[kdcdefaults] section with primary_ports and secondary_ports
		to list ports to listen on.  Consolidate all port location here
		from network.c.  Add -s flag and change meaning of -p flag to
		be the default if none specified in KDC or Kerberos profile.
	* network.c - Open list of primary ports and then per-realm ports.

Sat Jul  8 17:40:10 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos_v4.c (v4_klog): Also log L_KRB_PERR error messages, so
		we know when there are protocol problems.

Fri Jul 7 16:05:57 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove all explicit library handling and LDFLAGS.
	* configure.in - Add USE_<mumble> and KRB5_LIBRARIES.

Thu Jun 29 06:50:08 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* kerberos_v4.c (check_princ): delete master_key_version check,
	since we never actually set it.
	(main): elide original V4 server code to avoid confusion when
	looking for variable references.
	(type_2_v5err): reformat for 79 columns instead of 80 and
	conditionalize out since it is unused (though still informative.)

	* main.c - Change profile name hierarchy storage to const char *.  Add
		signal name argument to signal handler to conform to prototype.

		is to avoid having to rewrite everything to pass a pointer to
		the active realm.
	* kdc_util.c - Change "kdc_context" to "kcontext" because of #defines
		in extern.h.  Also add logic after call to rd_req_decoded
		to see if it failed because of a rcache error.  If so, then
		reinitialize the replay cache and retry it.
		Also change KDB_CONVERT_KEY_OUTOF_DB to decrypt_key.
	* kerberos_v4.c - Remove extraneous definition of master_encblock.
	* krb5kdc.M - Add definition of -p, add vague reference to kdc.conf
		manpage and describe multiple realms briefly.
	* network.c - Change udp_port_fd to a list of fds to support having
		multiple ports to listen on.

		change target link line to use $(LD) and associated flags.

		KRB4_LIB and KRB4_CRYPTO_LIB, these were
                split out.
	* configure.in - Remove dbm library checks, these are no longer needed
		with the Berkeley database code.  Also, add shared library
		usage check.

Tue Jun 13 12:44:20 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* network.c: Base inclusion of sys/select.h on whether it exists
        instead of a specific test for AIX.

Fri Mar 24 14:58:07 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* replay.c: The KDC replay cache needs to store the database
		modification time, so that if the database is modified in
		between when it receives a request and when it receives a
		replay of the same request, it knows to throw away the
		replay cache entry and generate a new response (since the
		record in the database on which the response is based may
		have been modified).

Fri Feb 10 14:35:42 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* do_tgs_req.c (process_tgs_req): krb5_use_keytype() was being
		called when the argument was a encryption type.   Change
		use to krb5_use_cstype().  Actually, any use of
		krb5_use_keytype() is a bug by definition.

Wed Feb 01 21:07:03 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* kdc_util.c (kdc_rdreq_keyproc()) Add krb5_keytype() arg.

		ticket; it will be freed as part of other structures.

	* do_tgs_req.c (process_tgs_req): Set the encryption type in the
		reply structure, and set the eblock type accordingly.

Wed Dec  7 13:36:34 1994    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* do_as_req.c (process_as_req): Set the encryption type in the
		reply_encpart structure.

	* do_as_req.c (process_as_req): Use the list of encryption types
		passed as part of the KDC request to determine which
		encryption to use for encrypting the ticket.  The
		encryption must be one that is supported by the KDC, as
		well as being one which is marked as being supported by
		the server of the ticket.  In a AS request, also use this
		encryption for encrypting the KDC response.  In a TGS
		request, use the encryption type of the TGT authenticator
		to determine how to encrypt the KDC response. 

Tue Nov  8 17:51:30 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* do_tgs_req.c (process_tgs_req): Use published interface to call

	* do_as_req.c (process_as_req): Don't assume that the request
		server's realm name is null terminated.  Compare the
		request server against changepw/kerberos using
		krb5_principal_compare.

		that both arguments are principals.  This makes it less
		confusing....

		so that add_to_transited doesn't assume that the contents
		of a krb5_data->data are null terminated.

	* do_tgs_req.c (process_tgs_req): Add the realm of the presented
	  tgt if it is different from the local realm (cross-realm) and it
	  is different than the realm of the client (since the realm of
	  the client is already implicitly part of the transited list and
	  should not be explicitly listed).
