	* standalone.exp: Only run the keytab to srvtab tests if kerberos 4
	support is compiled into the source tree.

2002-09-30  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp (rsh_test): Explicitly call stop_rsh_daemon upon pass
	for "encrypted rsh" test, to avoid zombies.

2002-04-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp (v4ftp_test): Update checked messages for change of
	"credentials cache file" to "credentials cache" in error message
	table.

2002-03-07  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* standalone.exp: Move setting of KLIST and KDESTROY into
	default.exp.
	(doit): Call do_klist instead of implementing it here.  Add a new
	principal to the database, and test getting tickets using a
	keytab, with multiple kvnos starting at 253 and going up past
	256; if first supported enctype supports v4, convert the keytab to
	a srvtab and try getting tickets using it too.  Verify that
	kadmin.local can read the high kvno correctly.

	default.exp.  Print correct filename in top-level error message.
	(check_and_destroy_v4_tix): New proc.

	in the keytab, before running test.

2001-11-06  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

        * rsh.exp: Fix date-grabbing regexp to deal with older versions of
	expect/tcl that have limited regexp capabilities.

12001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp: Fix date grabbing code so we don't try to parse the
	timezone-less date out of of a syslog message.  expect eof in
	places to drain pty buffers and avoid deadlock.

2001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: Calling send_error from within a dejagnu test is
	wrong.  So is calling exit.  Fix to not do these things.  Expect
	eof rather than "\r" so as to drain pty buffers and avoid
	deadlock.

2001-11-02  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp: Calling send_error from within a dejagnu test is
	wrong.  So is calling exit.  Fix to not do these things.  Expect
	eof rather than "\r" so as to drain pty buffers and avoid
	deadlock.

2001-10-26  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp, rsh_exp (stop_rsh_daemon): Do not close a process and
	then look for eof. Some versions of expect go through a full
	timeout in this scenario and others return immediately. New order:
	kill process, expect eof, close, and then wait.

2001-10-25  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp (rsh_test): Add stop_rsh_daemon before invoking
	start_rsh_daemon again to prevent running out of ptys.

2001-10-24  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: Corrected a couple of unimportant typos.  Added procedures
	kadmin_addpol, kadmin_delpol, kadmin_listpols, kadmin_modpol, and
	kadmin_showpol, which provide the tools with which to perform policy
	tests.  Added some basic policy operations to the tests of basic
	kadmin functions.  Added a test case to exercise the kadmind crash
	that used to occur when the history number of a policy was decreased.

2001-10-24  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp (stop_rsh_daemon): Call "expect eof" to drain pty buffer
	and avoid deadlock.

	* rsh.exp (stop_rsh_daemon, rsh_test): Call "expect eof" to drain
	pty buffer and avoid deadlock.

2001-07-04  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp, gssftp.exp: Test transfering a file > 1MB to
 	exercise PBSZ failure.

2001-06-22  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp: Use $tmppwd rather than hardcoding tmpdir.

	* v4krb524d.exp: New tests for the krb524d and k524init programs. 

2001-06-08  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: During test, set KRB5CCNAME to a non-existant
	cache. Restore at end to previous setting. This prevents failures
	caused when the krb5 cache contains valid information - as in the
	case of this test being run immediately after the gssftp.exp test.

2001-06-08  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp: Invocation of ftpd changed to use -U /dev/null and
	-a so that the test may successfully be run by root without failing
	(i.e. root is granted ftp access) and without opening the running
	ftpd to a password attack (i.e. authorization is required).
	Check for successful login messages added.

	* v4gssftp.exp: Same changes.

2001-06-06  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* v4gssftp.exp: Allow for "decrypt integrity check failed" error
	minor code from GSSAPI as well.

	* v4gssftp.exp: New tests for the krb4 compatible interface to gssftp. 

2000-08-08  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@engrailed.mit.edu>

	* v4standalone.exp: New set of tests for basic V4 functionality.

2000-07-04  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rsh.exp: Drain buffers on klist test to avoid wedging rsh on
	exit under HP/UX.

	* gssapi.exp: Rework significantly to deal with HP/UX lossage that
	probably resulted from when either the client or the server wound
	up blocking on tty output.  Abstract things a little more.  Remove
	dead duplicate code that used to deal with "-v2".  Should figure
	out why the "-v2" stuff disappeared mysteriously.

2000-02-07  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: Use $KDESTROY -5 to deal with changed behavior.

2000-02-06  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* standalone.exp: Use $KLIST -5 and $KDESTROY -5 to deal with
	changed behavior in these programs.  Wait for eof in some cases to
	avoid hanging.

 	requires it. [krb5-misc/487]

Mon Nov 11 20:54:37 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>
	Tue Sep 17 19:19:56 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* gssapi.exp (doit): Add more info to first set of "gssclient3"
	failure messages.  Drain client-side output in gssclient3 tests
	also, to prevent hanging on HP-UX.

	* gssftp.exp: Check for "foo: No such file or directory" in
	addition to "foo not found".

	* kadmin.exp: Added back in. Rewritten to use new admin system.

Tue Jul 23 23:40:05 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp: removed, since it was for the old admin server.

Mon Jul 22 04:19:46 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* gssftp.exp (ftp_test): check for the banner with -nocase, since
 	hostnames are case insensitive.

	* rcp.exp: Use a wrapper script to set up the remote rcp as
		started from kshd. 

	* rsh.exp: Setup a wrapper script in executing klist in the remote
		shell so that environment variables are properly set.

	* rsh.exp: Add tests for ticket forwarding.

	Thu Mar 28 19:30:53 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* kadmin.exp and gssapi.exp: Fix syntax of expect_after blocks.
  	The -i $foo must be inside the {, and the { must be by itself at
 	the end of the line.
	* gssftp.exp (start_ftp_daemon): use krb5.conf, not krb.conf

	Thu Mar 28 17:32:47 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	interface.
	(kadmin_add): match more of extended output (tentative change,
	should be expanded later to actually check the values.)

	* gssftp.exp: Fix the expect string so that it doesn't assume that
		the client is using its fully qualified domain name as its
		local hostname.  We now check to make sure that FTP banner
		contains $localhostname, plus optional characters (which
		can be the domainname depending on the system.)

Mon Apr  8 14:13:06 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* rcp.exp: Invoke kshd with -L for every environment variable we

	* kadmin.exp - Remove parameters from command lines of admin utilities
		because they're not needed anymore since we have the KDC

	* rcp.exp: (rcp_test()): Encrypted rcp are no longer expected to
		fail. 

Fri May 05 09:21:21 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)
