Fri Oct 18 14:23:41 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* dump.c (load_db): osa_adb_rename_policy_db will create the db,
 	so this function doesn't have to [krb5-admin/58]

	* dump.c (dump_k5beta6_iterator): don't dump tl types that are
 	special to us and the previous version did not understand
 	[krb5-admin/89]

Tue Oct  8 13:35:56 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* dump.c (load_db): rework the way policy database naming and
 	renaming is handled; the code no longer depends on being able to
 	specify admin_dbname specifically (which is no longer supported by
 	the libraries), uses osa_adb_rename_policy instead of doing it
 	directly, and will create a policy db if one does not already
 	exist.  Automated testing is needed. [krb5-admin/62]

	* dump.c (load_db): rename osa_adb_rename_policy to *_db

Thu Oct  3 18:17:36 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_util.c (ARG_VAL): case second half of ?: operator to char *
 	to fix problem on AIX; this should have worked anyway because of
 	the , operator but it is easy enough to force the solution, too.
	[krb5-admin/41]

Tue Sep 10 14:16:40 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.M: remove extra args from .TH

	* kdb5_util.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Mon Sep  9 11:06:29 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* loadv4.c: Don't call get_config_params again, since it's not
 		necessary, and breaks the policy database name if it is
 		manually set.

Wed Sep  4 17:34:58 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* loadv4.c (load_v4db): Fix argument parsing so that it actually works!
		Eliminated the -f option, as it is superfluous.  Don't
		create the policy database if using the -t option, since
		it'll already exist.

	* kdb5_util.c (usage): Fix usage message so that it's correct for
	 	load_v4.

Tue Sep  3 22:12:54 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* kdb5_stash.c (kdb5_stash): Ignore (expected) failure in stashing
		key when key not already present in returning exit status.

Mon Aug  5 14:36:47 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@DUN-DUN-NOODLES>

	* all files: reworked for non-ss usage; kdb5_util_ct.ct and
        ss_wrapper.c are now obsolete

Thu Aug  1 14:34:51 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@DUN-DUN-NOODLES>

	* dump.c, kadm5_create.c, kdb5_create.c: create policy database
        and kadm5 principals when loading a databas

	* loadv4.c: create empty policy database after loading V4 dump file

		open_db_and_mkey when creating database in returning exit
		status.

Wed Jul 24 02:57:16 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* loadv4.cdumpv4.c : Fixes for Athena Kerberos

Wed Jul 24 02:47:07 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for kdc.h and krb_db.h for Athena Kerberos.

Tue Jul 23 17:03:42 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@voltage-multiplier.mit.edu>

	* cpw.c (enter_pwd_key): krb5_dbe_cpw() takes a kvno now.

Tue May  7 23:16:57 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: USE_KADM_LIBRARY replaced by USE_KADMSRV_LIBRARY

Thu Apr 11 19:32:36 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): Use the matching key_data's kvno;
	don't assume that key_data[0]'s kvno is necessarily the matching
	key_data's kvno.

Wed Apr 10 19:17:58 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): Translate the principal name to
	the common V4 name.

Tue Mar 19 18:00:58 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): do not test to make sure we
	fetched a key of enctype 1 (des-cbc-crc), since we may have gotten
	another des key from the database, which is just as useful in a
	v4 srvtab

	* dumpv4.c (dump_v4_iterator): use krb5_524_conv_principal to do the
	v5 to v4 principal translation, instead of having yet another
	hard-coded table.

Wed Mar  6 16:17:20 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* dumpv4.c: The V4 master key & schedule was never initialized,
	so the dump created by dump_v4db was garbage.	Read the V4
	master key from /.k or prompt for the V4 master key password.
	  If there is no V4-salt key in the database, but there is a DES
	key, include it in the V4 dump, in case it is merely a random 
	service key for which there is no associated password.
	  Skip over K/M in the V5 database (use the entered V4 master key).
	  Both krbtgt and afs keys often have domain-qualifed instances.

Tue Mar  5 12:18:22 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* dump.c: POSIX locking requires that the file be opened read-write.

	* kdb5_edit.c: new command line option -f stashfile.
	* kdb5_edit.M: document stashfile option.

Mon Feb 26 22:13:45 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dump.c (process_k5beta_record): since V4 salt type has no data
 	either, only set key_data_ver to 1 for data_type 0 with 0-length
 	salt. Also, don't include alternate key if akey has all-zero type
	and length in both fields.

Sat Feb 24 04:02:18 1996  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dump.c (process_k5beta_record): encrypted keys used to have 4
	byte lengths in MSB order, need to convert to 2 byte LSB order
	lengths before storing. Handle primary key and alternate key.

Fri Feb 23 18:44:10 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): set manual_mkey for testing with -P

	* kdb5_edit.c (enter_master_key, set_dbname_help): If master key
		enctype is unknown, set to DEFAULT_KDC_ENCTYPE.

Tue Feb 13 16:08:07 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_v4_srvtab): krb5_dbekd_decrypt_key_data
		takes krb5_key_data *, not **.

Tue Jan 30 18:28:57 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dump.c (load_db): dbrenerr_fmt prints "from" first, so pass it
	to fprintf correctly.

Sun Jan 28 14:31:47 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* dump.c (process_k5_record): t2..t9 is only 8 vars, not 9.

Thu Jan 25 16:07:42 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.c (extract_srvtab): Extract *all* the keys in a
        dbentry, not the first one.
	(extract_v4_srvtab): Attempt to find the right v4 keys.

Wed Jan 24 18:48:38 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* cpw.c (enter_rnd_key, enter_pwd_key):
	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Use the kdc.conf file to determine
		the default list of keysalt tuples to be used.  This is
		stored in std_ks_tuple, and is used by cpw.c for random
		keys and when a list of keysalts is not specified.

Mon Sep 18 03:59:47 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

		has already been done.
	* Makefile.in, .Sanitize, loadv4.c, kdb5_ed_ct.ct - Add lddb4, the

	* configure.in: just use WITH_KRB4.

Wed Apr 19 13:59:47 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): If a default realm is specified
		(with -r), use krb5_set_default_realm so that created keys
		will have the correct realm.

Thu Mar 23 23:28:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kdb5_edit.c (show_principal, parse_princ_args): Add

		others.... 

Wed Nov 16 01:03:42 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* dumpv4.c: new file. New command dump_v4db which creates a v4
	slave dump out of a v5 database, leaving out any keys which aren't
	using v4 salt, and any keys that aren't for the current
	realm. Reencrypts using v4 master key, synthesizes arbitrary
	master key version number.
	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4 for dump support.
	* kdb5_ed_ct.ct: add new dump_v4 command.
	* Makefile.in: link in dumpv4.

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Don't let errors in
		set_dbname_help initially cause the exit status to be set.
		Commands like load_db don't need a valid database to be

	* ss_wrapper.c (main): Clear code before ss_execute_line, since
		ss_execute_line doesn't set code to 0 if there are no
	problems. 

	* kdb5_edit.c (kdb5_edit_Init): Add a new option so that the
