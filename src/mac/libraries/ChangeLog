	* KerberosHeaders.h (PROVIDE_DES_CBC_RAW): Fix #define of
		PROVIDE_DES_CBC_RAW so that the mac implementation
		actually exported the raw DES encryption system (needed
		for GSSAPI).  Also added defines for the triple-DES
		encryption systems.

Wed Mar 27 00:07:46 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Add #define of HAVE_STDLIB_H, since
		Macintoshes have it!

Wed Wed 27 18:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* KerberosHeaders.h: Created the file with the contents of 
		KerberosHeaders.pch so that KerberosHeadersCFM.pch can 
		also use it.
	
	* KerberosHeadersCFM.pch: Added file so that CFM compiler
		can	use a private binary header file.

Wed Wed 27 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* autoconf.h: File is now moved to include directory as 
		Makefile.in is run to create kerbsrc.tar.  Also 
		the file has been cleaned up as it is not
		automatically generated.

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Mac project files have been reworked.
		The CFM projects are now called "Kerberos 5 Library"
		and "GSS Library".  The GSS library project includes 
		the Kerberos 5 Library so you must install both
		libraries in the system folder to use the GSS API
		interface.

Wed Sep 20 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Updated project files to exclude verification 
		files so users can link without the benefits of a 
		preimplemented main.

	* KerberosHeaders.pch:  Updated to handle change password.

Sun Sep 10 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* ChangeLog created

	* libraries.sit.hqx: Project files changed to include new files 
		and renamed files.
