/*
 * The k5buf module is intended to allow multi-step string construction in a
 * fixed or dynamic buffer without the need to check for a failure at each step
 * (and without aborting on malloc failure).  If an allocation failure occurs
 * or if the fixed buffer runs out of room, the error will be discovered when
 * the caller retrieves the C string value or checks the length of the
 * resulting buffer.
 *
 * k5buf structures are stack-allocated, but are intended to be opaque, so do
 * not access the fields directly.  This is a tool, not a way of life, so do
 * not put k5buf structure pointers into the public API or into significant
 * internal APIs.
