Mon May 20 02:51:06 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Ultrix CC wants krb5_seteuid to take uid_t so that the
 	type can be promoted from a short.

Sat May 18 16:53:06 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Add krb5_seteuid

Tue May 14 20:29:09 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* krb5.hin: replaced CKSUMTYPE_SHA_DES3 with CKSUMTYPE_HMAC_SHA

Thu May  9 19:28:48 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Added new field values for ap_req_sumtype and
	 	safe_sumtype.  Added new convenience function for
		verifying magic numbers: KRB5_VERIFY_MAGIC.

	* krb5.hin (krb5_auth_con_set_req_cksumtype,
	 	krb5_auth_con_set_safe_cksumtype): Added prototypes of
		new functions, to replace old krb5_auth_con_setcksumtype.

Fri May 10 01:26:24 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* k5-int.h krb5.hin: Replaced 3des-md5 with 3des-sha.

Tue May  7 17:19:17 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* k5-int.h: We are providing 3DES routines in libcrypto, too...

Thu May  2 18:41:00 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* krb5.hin: krb5_init_random_key & krb5_finish_random_key now
		pass the eblock to the underlying crypto routine.

Fri May  3 00:26:47 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb5.hin
	(krb5_get_credentials_validate): declaration for new function.
	(krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_validate): ditto.

Thu May  2 22:52:14 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_rd_req_decoded_anyflag): declaration for new
	function, see rd_req_dec.c for details.

Tue Apr 30 14:51:55 1996    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Fix Windows definition of PROVIDE_DES_CBC_RAW so that
		the raw DES cryptosystem is properly included.  Removed
		Macintosh definitions of PROVIDE_* since that is done in
		mac/libaries/KerberosHeaders.h.

Thu Apr 11 23:50:24 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_x, krb5_xc): Fix wrapper macros so they don't
		try to dereference a function pointer as a data value.
		This doesn't work if you're using hpux cc, since functions
		are aligned on 2-byte boundaries, but data has to be
		accessed on 4-byte boundaries.  Accessing a function as a
		data value isn't ANSI C portable anyway.  :-)  Wrapper
		macros now take a function pointer, and check to see if
		the function pointer is non-NULL, instead of taking a
		(*funptr), and seeing if the function when treated as data
		object is non-NULL. 

Wed Apr 10 10:37:21 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krb5.hin (krb5_validate_times): Add prototype of new function.

Tue Apr  9 22:40:49 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* k5-int.h: add prototypes for sam preauth functions.

Thu Mar 28 19:55:04 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* krb5.hin: Added ENCTYPE_DES3_CBC_RAW

Wed Mar 20 22:55:50 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_pa_data): Change type of pa_type field in
		krb5_pa_data to be krb5_preauthtype, for consistency's
		sake.  Added prototype for krb5_copy_addr().  Change type
		of etype in krb5_etype_info_entry to be krb5_enctype, for
		consistency's sake.

Sat Feb 24 21:46:13 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (all-windows): hpux make doesn't grok $@, so I'm
	        told.  Use explicit target names for building errortable
	        include files.

Fri Feb 23 18:59:18 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_x, krb5_xc): wrapper macros to test all function
	pointers before calling through them (abort if null.) Simplifies
	debugging on many platforms. Currently #if 1, but could be
	conditionalized once we're in "production".

Wed Feb 21 23:33:18 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* Makefile.in: Do not install k5-int.h

Wed Jan 10 22:46:51 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Add fields for fcc_default_format and
	        scc_default_format in krb5_context structure.

Tue Jan  9 22:23:31 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_fwd_tgt_creds, krb5_os_hostaddr): Added new
		function prototypes.

Thu Jan  4 22:49:13 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin: Added support for KRB5_INT16_MAX, which tells us the
		limitations of using 16 bit ints.

Sun Nov 26 19:23:35 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* k5-int.h: Ultrix is broken.  Hacked around by redefining the
		typedefs of preauth_obtain_data_proc and
		preauth_process_proc to be pointers to the functions
		rather than the functions themselves.  Also made some
		things KRB5_NPROTOTYPE.

Fri Nov 17 22:29:13 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin, k5-int.h: Moved prototype for encode_kdc_rep to
		k5-int.h, and remove the eblock argument.

Mon Nov 13 11:49:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Added typedef for krb5_preauth_proces_proc, and
		changed the prototype of krb5_process_padata() to take
		additional arguments for returning the decryption key to
		use for decrypting the as_reply, as well as passing in the
		decrypt_proc procedure in case some preauth types want to
		call decrypt_proc themselves.

	* krb5.hin: Add prototypes for krb5_encrypt_data(),
		krb5_decrypt_data(). 

Thu Nov 09 17:05:57 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * krb5.hin : Remove krb5_enctype from krb5_string_to_key() args.

Thu Nov  9 00:04:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Remove etype_info from the argument list of
	        krb5_obtain_padata.

Wed Nov  8 02:53:48 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin: Add preauthentication type KRB5_PADATA_ETYPE_INFO.

	* k5-int.h: Add declaration for krb5_free_etype_info.

	* krb5.hin: Removed internal functions krb5_encrypt_tkt_part,
		krb5_verify_padta, and krb5_obtain_padata from the public
		header file.

	* k5-int.h: Removed old preauthentication declarations and added
		new ones.  Changed function prototype of
		krb5_encrypt_tkt_part.

Tue Nov 7 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* k5-int.h: Place stat declation inside #ifndef __MWERKS__ so
		as not to conflict with the definition in the 
		MetroWerks compiler.

Tue Oct 24 17:31:36 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Manually defined PROVIDE_* for Macintosh and MS-DOS so
		that libcrypto knows which encryption systems to include.
		Otherwise, we would be building an exportable (and
		useless) krb5 library for the Mac and PC.

Fri Oct  6 21:59:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.
		config/windows.in is now included by wconfig.

Thu Oct  5 21:31:10 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin: Change types of krb5_max_enctype and
		krb5_max_cksumtype to be krb5_enctype and krb5_cksumtype,
		to fix some gcc -Wall flames.

Thu Oct  5 07:34:51 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Add profile_secure to context.

	* krb5.hin: Add krb5_secure_config_profile prototype.

Fri Sep 29 15:17:30 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: If krb5/autoconf.h doesn't exist, cd to krb5 and
		make it.

		Don't make krb5-pro.h; this confuses things under Windows,
		since Windows attempts to build krb5-pro.h and then
		rebuildes krb5.h, when it shouldn't do that.  Fold in the
		krb5-pro.h rules as part of the rules for krb5.h.  This
		way, they don't get executed under DOS, since krb5.h
		already exists under DOS.

Fri Sep 29 13:35:08 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove krb5-pro.h
	              (krb5-pro.h): Add HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H file so that
		      sys/types.h may be included definition of size_t for
		      krb5.h  

Fri Sep 29 01:35:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: #include "osconf.h" all the time, at the beginning of
		the file.

Tue Sep 26 15:18:26 1995    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* k5-int.h: Don't predefine symbols to stop kdb.h and kdb_dbm.h
		for _MSDOS.

	* krb5.hin, k5-int.h: Move some src/lib/krb5/os prototypes to
		krb5.hin.

Mon Sep 25 16:39:21 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Sat Sep 23 01:37:19 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* krb5.hin: Added preauth numbers for KRB5_CYBERSAFE_SECUREID and
	        KRB5_PADATA_AFS3_SALT.

Fri Sep 22 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>

	* k5-int.h: removed define for OLD_CONFIG_FILES for 
		change password

Fri Sep 22 19:42:47 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Change length field in krb5_alt_method and
		krb5_etype_info_entry to be an int, instead of an int32.
		This allows the ASN.1 length parsing routines to work
		properly. 

	* k5-int.h: (from Keith Vetter's windows changes); define
		THREEPARAMOPEN and prototype for sscanf.  Also add #define
		for strncasecmp() to the microsoft's strnicmp() function.

Tue Sep 12 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* k5-int.h: Removed KRB5_REALM_CANT RESOLVE,
		PROF_NO_SECTION and PROF_NO_RELATION defines
		as they are also defined in KerberosIV/krb_err.h
		and util/profile/prof_err.et and create conflicts
		on the Mac.

Sun Sep 10 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>

	* krb5.hin:  Conditionalized inclusion of <sts/types.h> for _MACINTOSH

Wed Sep  6 12:00:00 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>

	* k5-int.h:  Added requisite defines, fake struct definitions for compilation
		on MACINTOSH.

Wed Sep 06 14:20:57 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * k5-int.h krb5.hin : s/keytype/enctype/g, s/KEYTYPE/ENCTYPE/g

Tue Sep 05 22:10:34 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * k5-int.h, krb5.hin : Remove krb5_enctype references, and replace with
                krb5_keytype where appropriate.

Fri Sep  1 00:44:59 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Added clockskew, kdc_req_sumtype, and
		kdc_default_options to the krb5_context structure.

	* krb5.hin: Added expected nonce and request_time fields to the
	        krb5_response structure.  The fields are used to pass
		information from krb5_send_tgs() to
		krb5_get_cred_via_tkt() so that it can do sanity checking.

	* k5-int.h: Add time offset field to the os_context structure.
		This offset is added to the system clock time to produce
		the "true" time.  

		Added prototypes for the functions which manipulate the
		time offset structures: krb5_set_real_time(),
		krb5_set_debugging_time(), krb5_use_natural_time(),
		krb5_get_time_offsets(), and krb5_set_time_offsets().

Tue Aug 29 13:26:22 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Add ser_ctx[_count] to krb5_context.  This keeps track
		of registered serializers.  Add serializer definitions and
		prototypes.
	* krb5.hin - Add priv_size to krb5_encrypt_block.  This indicates the
		size of the private data.  Add pointer to keytab ops for
		serializer handle.

	* k5-int.h: Added two new data structures: krb5_alt_method and
	        krb5_etype_info (and krb5_etype_info_entry).  

Fri Aug 25 17:12:37 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* k5-int.h: Added prototypes for encode_krb5_padata_sequence and
	        decode_krb5_padata_sequence.

Wed Aug 16 02:45:19 1995  Chris Provenzano <proven@mit.edu>

	*  k5-int.h (krb5_lock_file(), krb5_unlock_file()):
		Use fds instead of FILE *s and don't pass the filename.

Fri Aug  4 23:04:06 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* k5-int.h: Add prototypes for krb5_crypto_os_localaddr and
		krb5_crypto_us_timeofday

Thu Jul 27 15:04:37 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Inline or delete header files included here.  These were:
		{asn1, dbm, ext-proto, k5-config, k5-errors, k5-sockets,
		 libos, los-proto, mit-des, preauth, rsa-md5 and sysincl}.h
		Also remove #defines which controlled the KDC, move these
		definitions to kdc/configure.in.

Thu Jul 27 04:27:45 1995  Chris Provenzano <proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.hin : Added #define KEYTYPE_UNKNOWN

Tue Jul 11 13:12:14 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin (krb5_cc_get_type, krb5_kt_get_type): Add the new

	* krb5.hin: Change definition of krb5_os_localaddr to include
		context argument.

Wed July  5 15:52:31 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>
	* k5-int.h disable inclusion of profile.h for macintosh build
	* krb5.h   enable inclusion of sys/types.h on HAS_SYS_TYPES

Thu Jun 29 22:54:30 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness (again!) for
		KRB5_CONST; krb5.h breaks when typedef'ing while
		installed.  Yuck.

Tue Jun 27 16:14:38 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* krb5.hin - Reinstate KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES.  This is needed for
		compilers which recognize prototypes but don't set __STDC__
		or _WINDOWS.

Thu Jun 22 16:03:07 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* syslog.h: reverse sense of KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES
	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness, reverse sense of
		KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES (becomes KRB5_NO_PROTOTYPES);
		also, NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES -> KRB5_NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES
	* Makefile.in: don't install NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES, HAS_VOID_TYPE,
		and KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES symbols into krb5.h

Thu Jun 22 11:51:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Add pointer in krb5_context for database context.

Wed Jun 21 10:54:58 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, krb5.hin: Don't include autoconf.h anymore; have
		the Makefile include the few configure symbols which
		krb5.h needs.

	* krb5.hin: Change PROTOTYPE -> KRB5_PROTOTYPE and 
		NPROTOTYPE -> KRB5_NPROTOTYPE.

Fri Jun 16 11:39:36 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Fix install logic for krb5.h and k5-int.h.

Sun Jun 11 09:20:29 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

Sat Jun 10 22:10:46 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krb5.hin: declare krb5_auth_context as
		struct _krb5_auth_context FAR *

Fri Jun  9 18:43:20 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Remove definition of the krb5_fulladdr structure, and
		the prototype for the unused function krb5_fulladdr_order.

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

Fri Jun 9 12:02:02 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in(all-unix) : Add adm_err.h build target since it's not 
		built in lib/krb5/error_tables any more.  kadmin.old needs it.

Tue Jun  6 12:25:38 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krb5.hin: Add prototype for krb5_524_conv_principal()

Tue May 30 10:59:13 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove built header files krb5.h
		krb5_err.h kdb5_err.h kv5m_err.h asn1_err.h 

Wed May 24 10:54:34 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- Change $< to explicit target names when generating
			  error table header files.  OSF/1 and Ultrix-native
			  make only expand $< on suffix rules.

Tue May 23 22:07:02 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Remove krb5_encode_ticket as it does not exist in
		library. 

Tue May 23 15:08:54 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, krb5.hin: Move krb5.h to krb5.hin,
		and build krb5.h from krb5.hin and the error table
		include files, which are now built in this directory.
		This way, krb5.h is the only include file that we need to
		install.

	* k5-int.h: Move the sockets specific setup out of k5-config.h to
		  k5-sockets.h, and modify k5-int to include k5-sockets.h
		  (if it is requested by NEED_SOCKETS) after including
		  krb5.h.  This keeps the gdb type numbers the same across
		  .o files, so that recent binuntils can compress the
		  debugging information in executables linked with a
		  debugging library.

Mon May 22 10:24:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- (install) Always perform install actions using
			  $(INSTALL_DATA).
	* configure.in	- locate install program.

Wed May  3 10:32:18 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: (krb5_auth_con_setports): Added missing prototype.
	          (krb5_auth_con_getkey): Added as well.

Wed May 03 03:30:51 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h: (krb5_recvauth()): No longer needs the rc_type arg.

	* krb5.h (krb5_get_cred_via_tkt()) : Added prototype.
	* krb5.h (krb5_mk_ncred(), krb5_mk_1cred(), krb5_rd_cred()):
		Updated prototype to include auth_context.

Fri Apr 21 08:58:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: krb5_princ_aref() doesn't work, and isn't used anywhere.
		Removed.  (So all of macros.h is gone.)

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Moved struct _krb5_context to k5-int.h

Thu Apr 20 12:15:54 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* krb5.h: Needs SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG defined for the PC.

Wed Apr 29 10:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: duplicated the file copying stuff from 
           ..\gssapi\generic so that all the copying stuff can be
           found in one place.

Thu Apr 20 11:32:09 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Inlined the following include files, to
		simplify the header files which actually need to be
		installed: wordsize.h, base-defs.h, hostaddr.h,
		fieldbits.h, proto.h, macros.h, error_def.h, safepriv.h,
		ccache.h, rcache.h, keytab.h, func-proto.h, k5-free.h.
		Also moved the #include of k5-config.h and k5-errors.h to
		k5-int.h.

Wed Apr 19 13:23:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: Added default_realm pointer to krb5_context

Thu Apr 13 16:05:08 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* bsdlib.h, bstring.h, fake-std.h, syslog.h:  __STDC__ conditionals
           also check for the _WINDOWS define.
        * krb5.h: added FAR to pointers visible to the world.

Tue Mar 28 18:12:32 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (KRB5_HEADERS, install):  `Make install' now works.
	* configure.in (WITH_KRB5ROOT):  For `make install'.
	* krb5.h:  Include "k5-errors.h" rather than "errors.h".

Fri Mar 17 19:10:41 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* krb5.h:  Move <sys/types> and u_long (etc) code to krb5/k5-config.h.
	It is needed there when NEED_SOCKETS is defined.
	* Makefile.in (all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.

Wed Mar 15 20:27:57 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added recursion into krb5 for the PC.

Fri Mar 10 10:18:50 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krb5.h Added empty structure declaration of krb5_auth_context.

	* k5-int.h Moved #include "adm_defs.h" to krb5.h

Thu Mar  2 23:24:00 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	Make include files begin to work on the Macintosh.

	* k5-int.h:  Remove krb5/ from #includes.  Rearrange #includes
	so that time_t is defined before kdb.h is included.
	* krb5.h:  Include k5-config.h first, so its #define's can
	control the rest of the file.  If <sys/types.h> is not present,
	define u_long, etc, manually.

Wed Feb 22 18:31:12 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* k5-int.h:  Remove commented-out <widen.h> and <narrow.h>.
	* krb5.h: Same as old krb5/krb5.h, as a start.  Gradually things
	that don't need to be exported will be moved from krb5.h into
	k5-int.h (and vice verse for e.g. function prototypes).

Wed Jan 25 19:19:38 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	Make it possible to #include "..." without using slashes,
	for Macintosh support.

	* krb5.h:  New file, the externally visible interface to
	Kerberos V5.  Currently the whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.
	* k5-int.h:  New file, the internally visible declarations
	needed by source files that are part of the Kerberos V5 library
	itself.  Currently the same whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.

Fri Nov 18 00:16:31 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use WITH_CCOPTS.
