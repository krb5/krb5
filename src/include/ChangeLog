	* k5-int.h: Change length field in krb5_alt_method and
		krb5_etype_info_entry to be an int, instead of an int32.
		This allows the ASN.1 length parsing routines to work
		properly. 

	* k5-int.h: (from Keith Vetter's windows changes); define
		THREEPARAMOPEN and prototype for sscanf.  Also add #define
		for strncasecmp() to the microsoft's strnicmp() function.

Tue Sep 12 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* k5-int.h: Removed KRB5_REALM_CANT RESOLVE,
		PROF_NO_SECTION and PROF_NO_RELATION defines
		as they are also defined in KerberosIV/krb_err.h
		and util/profile/prof_err.et and create conflicts
		on the Mac.

		kdc_default_options to the krb5_context structure.

	* krb5.hin: Added expected nonce and request_time fields to the
	        krb5_response structure.  The fields are used to pass
		information from krb5_send_tgs() to
		krb5_get_cred_via_tkt() so that it can do sanity checking.

	* k5-int.h: Add time offset field to the os_context structure.
		This offset is added to the system clock time to produce
		the "true" time.  

		Added prototypes for the functions which manipulate the
		time offset structures: krb5_set_real_time(),
		krb5_set_debugging_time(), krb5_use_natural_time(),
		krb5_get_time_offsets(), and krb5_set_time_offsets().

Tue Aug 29 13:26:22 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Add ser_ctx[_count] to krb5_context.  This keeps track
		of registered serializers.  Add serializer definitions and
		prototypes.
	* krb5.hin - Add priv_size to krb5_encrypt_block.  This indicates the
		size of the private data.  Add pointer to keytab ops for

Thu Jun 29 22:54:30 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness (again!) for
		KRB5_CONST; krb5.h breaks when typedef'ing while
		installed.  Yuck.

Tue Jun 27 16:14:38 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* krb5.hin - Reinstate KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES.  This is needed for
		compilers which recognize prototypes but don't set __STDC__
		or _WINDOWS.

Thu Jun 22 16:03:07 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* syslog.h: reverse sense of KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES
	* krb5.hin: special-case ultrix brokenness, reverse sense of
		KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES (becomes KRB5_NO_PROTOTYPES);
		also, NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES -> KRB5_NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES
	* Makefile.in: don't install NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES, HAS_VOID_TYPE,
		and KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES symbols into krb5.h

Thu Jun 22 11:51:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k5-int.h - Add pointer in krb5_context for database context.

Wed Jun 21 10:54:58 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, krb5.hin: Don't include autoconf.h anymore; have
		the Makefile include the few configure symbols which
		krb5.h needs.

	* krb5.hin: Change PROTOTYPE -> KRB5_PROTOTYPE and 
		NPROTOTYPE -> KRB5_NPROTOTYPE.

Fri Jun 16 11:39:36 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

		struct _krb5_auth_context FAR *

Fri Jun  9 18:43:20 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.hin: Remove definition of the krb5_fulladdr structure, and
		the prototype for the unused function krb5_fulladdr_order.

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

Fri Jun 9 12:02:02 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in(all-unix) : Add adm_err.h build target since it's not 
		built in lib/krb5/error_tables any more.  kadmin.old needs it.

Tue Jun  6 12:25:38 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krb5.hin: Add prototype for krb5_524_conv_principal()

Wed May 24 10:54:34 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- Change $< to explicit target names when generating
			  error table header files.  OSF/1 and Ultrix-native
			  make only expand $< on suffix rules.

	* krb5.hin: Remove krb5_encode_ticket as it does not exist in
		library. 

Tue May 23 15:08:54 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, krb5.hin: Move krb5.h to krb5.hin,
		and build krb5.h from krb5.hin and the error table
		include files, which are now built in this directory.
		This way, krb5.h is the only include file that we need to
		install.

	* k5-int.h: Move the sockets specific setup out of k5-config.h to
		  k5-sockets.h, and modify k5-int to include k5-sockets.h
		  (if it is requested by NEED_SOCKETS) after including
		  krb5.h.  This keeps the gdb type numbers the same across
		  .o files, so that recent binuntils can compress the
		  debugging information in executables linked with a
		  debugging library.

Mon May 22 10:24:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- (install) Always perform install actions using

		Updated prototype to include auth_context.

Fri Apr 21 08:58:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h: krb5_princ_aref() doesn't work, and isn't used anywhere.
		Removed.  (So all of macros.h is gone.)

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Moved struct _krb5_context to k5-int.h

Thu Apr 20 12:15:54 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* krb5.h: Needs SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG defined for the PC.

Wed Apr 29 10:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: duplicated the file copying stuff from 
           ..\gssapi\generic so that all the copying stuff can be
           found in one place.

Thu Apr 20 11:32:09 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* krb5.h, k5-int.h: Inlined the following include files, to
		simplify the header files which actually need to be
		installed: wordsize.h, base-defs.h, hostaddr.h,
		fieldbits.h, proto.h, macros.h, error_def.h, safepriv.h,
		ccache.h, rcache.h, keytab.h, func-proto.h, k5-free.h.
		Also moved the #include of k5-config.h and k5-errors.h to

Thu Apr 13 16:05:08 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* bsdlib.h, bstring.h, fake-std.h, syslog.h:  __STDC__ conditionals
           also check for the _WINDOWS define.
        * krb5.h: added FAR to pointers visible to the world.

Tue Mar 28 18:12:32 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (KRB5_HEADERS, install):  `Make install' now works.
	* configure.in (WITH_KRB5ROOT):  For `make install'.
	* krb5.h:  Include "k5-errors.h" rather than "errors.h".

Fri Mar 17 19:10:41 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* krb5.h:  Move <sys/types> and u_long (etc) code to krb5/k5-config.h.

	Make include files begin to work on the Macintosh.

	* k5-int.h:  Remove krb5/ from #includes.  Rearrange #includes
	so that time_t is defined before kdb.h is included.
	* krb5.h:  Include k5-config.h first, so its #define's can
	control the rest of the file.  If <sys/types.h> is not present,
	define u_long, etc, manually.

Wed Feb 22 18:31:12 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* k5-int.h:  Remove commented-out <widen.h> and <narrow.h>.
	* krb5.h: Same as old krb5/krb5.h, as a start.  Gradually things
	that don't need to be exported will be moved from krb5.h into
	k5-int.h (and vice verse for e.g. function prototypes).

Wed Jan 25 19:19:38 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	Make it possible to #include "..." without using slashes,
	for Macintosh support.

	* krb5.h:  New file, the externally visible interface to
	Kerberos V5.  Currently the whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.

	itself.  Currently the same whole kitchen sink, to bootstrap.

Fri Nov 18 00:16:31 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>
