/*
 * Declarations for preauth plugin module implementors.
 *
 * This header defines two preauth interfaces, clpreauth and kdcpreauth.  A
 * shared object can implement both interfaces or it can implement just one.
 *
 *
 * The clpreauth interface has a single supported major version, which is
 * 1.  Major version 1 has a current minor version of 2.  clpreauth modules
 * should define a function named clpreauth_<modulename>_initvt, matching
 * the signature:
 *
 *   krb5_error_code
 *   clpreauth_modname_initvt(krb5_context context, int maj_ver,
 *                            int min_ver, krb5_plugin_vtable vtable);
 *
 * The kdcpreauth interface has a single supported major version, which is 1.
 * Major version 1 has a current minor version of 1.  kdcpreauth modules should
 * define a function named kdcpreauth_<modulename>_initvt, matching the
 * signature:
 *
 *   krb5_error_code
 *   kdcpreauth_modname_initvt(krb5_context context, int maj_ver, int min_ver,
 *                             krb5_plugin_vtable vtable);
 *
 * For both interfaces, the initvt function should:
 *
 * - Check that the supplied maj_ver number is supported by the module, or
 *   return KRB5_PLUGIN_VER_NOTSUPP if it is not.
 *
 * - Cast the vtable pointer as appropriate for the interface and maj_ver:
 *     clpreauth, maj_ver == 1:  Cast to krb5_clpreauth_vtable
 *     kdcpreauth, maj_ver == 1: Cast to krb5_kdcpreauth_vtable
 *
 * - Initialize the methods of the vtable, stopping as appropriate for the
 *   supplied min_ver.  Optional methods may be left uninitialized.
 *
 * Memory for the vtable is allocated by the caller, not by the module.
