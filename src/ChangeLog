Mon Sep 25 16:32:57 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS, DO_SUBDIRS): MAKE_SUBDIRS now takes
		three arguments; DO_SUBDIRS now generates target rules of
		the form: "foo-unix: <for each subdirectory> make foo".
		All of the macros which generated targets "all",
		"install", "clean", etc. now generate targets "all-unix",
		"install-unix", "clean-unix".  

		This scheme allows us to do multiple-platform builds,
		while preserving ordering constraints that we need in
		order to build library subdirectories correctly.

Sun Sep 24 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>

	* Makefile.in: Update CLEANUP list to clean up files created
		in the include directory rather than include/krb5
		directory.  Remove mac/build directory.

Fri Sep 22 19:39:30 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Exclude the MAC and DOS tar/zip files when creating
	        the Mac tar file.  Adjust the windows NT exclusion file so
		that it works correctly; zip is a little bit touchy about
		file specifications.

	* Makefile.in (awk-windows-mac): Build the error table header
		files into include, not include/krb5; and construct krb5.h
		from krb5.hin and the error table header files.

Fri Sep 15 05:05:15 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (kerbsrc-nt.zip): Update production rule to be like
		the modified kerbsrc.zip rule.

Tue Sep 12 22:06:24 1995  John Rivlin (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Added telnet to Mac file list

Mon Sep 11 22:06:24 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Update macintosh/dos file lists

Thu Aug 24 19:27:04 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* .Sanitize: Update file list

Tue Aug 22 18:19:39 1995    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): Change subdir recursion so that 
		a missing subdirectory is skipped.  

Mon Aug 21 16:42:42 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in - Change mkdir to mkdir -p.

Tue Aug 15 16:19:29 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: For OSF/1 specify that the -rpath directive takes
		a colon separated path.

	* aclocal.m4 (SHLIB_RPATH_DIRS): Allow for directory path to be
		colon separated for different directories.


Tue Aug 15 01:37:19 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in: Change some spaces back to tabs

Mon Aug  7 19:26:06 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* aclocal.m4 (SS_RULES): Add double quotes around "$}{*.ct"

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): Add $(SHELL) to invocation of
		autoconf, so that things work even if the execute bit
		isn't set on the shell script.

Tue Jul 18 19:20:49 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (KRB5_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN): Add space before = to keep
		shell happy. 

Sun Jul 16 05:02:41 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 : Defined KRB5_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN, a test to determine
        if sockaddr has the sa_len field.  

Wed Jul 12 11:47:43 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* aclocal.m4 - Add LDFLAGS setting to KRB5_LIBRARIES.  This allows
		building without using the rule V5_USE_SHARED_LIBS.  Also,
		don't pass LDFLAGS in recursion because this overrides
		the values in individual Makefiles.

Sun Jul  9 06:15:33 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>

	* aclocal.m4: backslash '$' characters that go into double-quoted
		strings so shells that treat $(foo) like `foo` won't barf

Sun Jul  9 01:31:25 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in: remove bogus definitions of prefix, etc.

Fri Jul 7 15:29:43 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* aclocal.m4 - Add ability to set LDFLAGS from --with-ldopts (I know,
		configure option doesn't coincide with make variable, but it
		corresponds to --with-ccopts).
		- Add ability to select libraries to link with from configure
		script.  This prevents us from having to change every makefile
		each time there's a library reorganization.  These macros are
		USE_{KADM,KDB5,KDB4,KRB4}_LIBRARIES and KRB5_LIBRARIES.
		Makefiles now only need to reference $(LIBS) for the list of
		libraries to link with and $(DEPLIBS) for the list of
		library dependencies.

Wed Jul  5 12:00:00 1995 James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com> 

	* Makefile.in: Added kerbsrc.mac target to facilitate easy 
	downloading pruned source tree to the Mac.

Tue Jul  4 02:11:14 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Add support for NetBSD shared libraries.

Sun Jul  2 20:25:58 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: For paranoid GPL reasons, don't take the Gcc test
        directly from the autoconf sources.  Instead, borrow my paraphrase
        of this test from util/configure.in.  It's slightly cleaner
        anyway.  Also, adjust AIX shared libs to work with Gcc.

Sun Jul  2 04:40:50 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@lothlorien.MIT.EDU>
	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): Fixed so that error propogates
		upward if -[ik] not specified.

	* aclocal.m4 (SubdirLibRule): don't recreate DONE if list of objs
		is null to avoid re-making lotsa stuff.
		(_MAKE_SUBDIRS): really gross sh hack for subdir
		recursion; make -[ik] should dtrt now even with broken
		makes (like Ultrix) that do sh -ce "rule".  Basically,
		throw an "if" test around the recursion line so that even
		if the -e option to sh is set by make, an error in a
		subdir below won't cause for loop to exit unless we want
		it to.

Fri Jun 30 14:26:01 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* aclocal.m4(V5_SHARED_LIB_OBJS) - Change explicit $(srcdir)/$*.c to
		$< so that sources which aren't in the source directory can
		get compiled correctly.

Wed Jun 28 20:13:10 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Proper test for GCC. (based on autoconf test).  
	 	If using gcc, set shlibs_ldflag and noshlibs_ldflag
		properly for compiler. (for OSF at least - may be more
		generic). 

Wed Jun 28 17:07:08 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* aclocal.m4 (KRB_INCLUDE): Search the build directories before
		the source directories.  (Doesn't hurt anything, and it
		helps in a few cases of user error.)

	* configure.in: Conditionalize on the name of CC to determine
		whether to use the gcc or suncc flags for shared
		libraries.  (This is a little bit ugly; we might want to
		use a better test later on.)

Wed Jun 28 10:43:10 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (INSTALL_VARIABLE_HACKSRCTOP): Work around bug in
		autoconf which causes a relative path for dnl
		AC_PROG_INSTALL to be cached.  We workaround this by
		unsetting the cache variable if it contains a relative
		pathname.

Tue Jun 27 16:28:23 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* acconfig.h - Reinstate KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES.  This is needed
		for compilers which recognize prototypes but don't set
		__STDC__ or _WINDOWS.

Fri Jun 23 20:14:45 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* aclocal.m4 (SHARED_RULE_LOCAL): Use makeshlib out of
        $(BUILDTOP)/util not $(SRCTOP)/util since it moved.

	* configure.in: Include appropriate binder option to set LIBPATH
        correctly in generated executables.

Thu Jun 22 16:15:10 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* acconfig.h: NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES -> KRB5_NO_NESTED_PROTOTYPES;
		KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES -> KRB5_NO_PROTOTYPES

Fri Jun 23 12:13:22 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Enable static library generation for Linux.

Fri Jun 23 11:48:04 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* aclocal.m4 (V5_MAKE_SHARED_RULE) Set STEXT when not making
		shared library.
		(CONFIG_RULES): Move AC_CONST from WITH_KRB4 definition. 

Wed Jun 21 18:10:40 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* aclocal.m4 (V5_SET_TOPDIR): Replace AC_CONFIG_FRAGMENTS,
		AC_CONFIG_FRAGMENTS_DEFUALT, AC_SET_BUILDTOP,
		AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR_DEFAULT with V5_SET_TOPDIR.  This sets
		up the correct variables for the top of the source tree
		and the top of the build tree.  It currently depends on
		AC_LOCALDIR being a relative pathname, but that's a safe
		assumption to make.  (And we could fix it to be more
		general if we really needed to.)

		Removed AC__CONFIG_AUX since it doesn't seem to be used at all.

Wed Jun 21 18:03:40 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: undefine AC_CONFIGF_AUX_DIR_DEFAULT before
		redefining it to avoid diversion madness

Wed Jun 21 17:38:34 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4: Add KRB5_SIGTYPE (taken from include/krb5) so that
		other applications may use defintion. 


Wed Jun 21 16:10:09 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* aclocal.m4 (SHARED_RULE_LOCAL): Add support for not making
        static libs.  Moves the clean and all target for shared libs in
        shared lib Makefiles into this rule instead of Makefile.in

	* configure.in: Added krb5_cv_noshlibs_ext, the extension for
        static libraries that have shared counterparts.  Also added
        krb5_cv_staticlibs_enabled, (set by the code for --enable-shared,
        not by any extra option) to determine whether static versions of
        shared libs are compiled on a per-platform basis.


 Wed Jun 21 14:57:55 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed extra blank lines and added "dnl" to the end
		of some macro definitions to get rid of extra newlines
		added at the beginning of configure scripts.

Tue Jun 20 12:23:20 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* BADSYMS: Updated after finding bugs in getsyms

Mon Jun 19 11:23:47 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* BADSYMS: list of bad symbols found in various source files;
		generated by util/getsyms

Sun Jun 18 20:57:35 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4: Must protect $(FOO) with a backslash, since $(FOO)
		is specially interpreted by bash (and Korn shells).

Fri Jun 16 00:45:03 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: ARCHIVE gets a "cqv" to shut it up about the warning

	* aclocal.m4: Fix new append.out stuff to work with config.status
		properly; previously append.out was not getting sucked
		into the body of config.status.  The EXTRA_RULES macros
		are deprecated and should not be used anymore.

	* aclocal.m4: people were using AC_DIVERSION_MAKEFILE inside
		conditionals, not realizing that it would not end up
		conditionalized.  Define a new macro AC_PUSH_MAKEFILE,
		along with AC_POP_MAKEFILE, to stuff things into a tmp
		file (append.out) to unconfuse things.

Thu Jun 15 21:59:22 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (V5_USE_SHARED_LIB): Quote arguments to test in
		case the values are blank.

Thu Jun 15 18:15:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* aclocal.m4 - Separate K4 libraries; Separate library specification
		from actual library path so we can do a dependency check
		using the DEP_<lib> and link with the library itself.
		- Add LinkFileDir(): a macro which generates a symlink in
		  another directory.
		- Figure out values for shared library parameters.
		- Add rules for building with these shared libraries.
	* configure.in - Add system-specific linker flags.

Wed Jun 14 16:51:28 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4(_MAKE_SUBDIRS): revert yet again; no workaround since
		subshells inherit "-e" flag.  Ultrix sucks.

	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): "-@" was the wrong answer; set a
		shell variable "e" to "exit 0" and execute it after the
		make in each subdirectory

Tue Jun 13 01:44:12 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (CopySrcHeader): do a set -x before mkdir
		_MAKE_SUBDIRS: inserted a "-@" rather than a "@" at the
		beginning of the rule; Ultrix make does /bin/sh -e
		ruleline if it's not there, and set +e doesn't work.

Sat Jun 10 08:14:22 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* acconfig.h: Removed HAS_ANSI_CONST, HAS_ANSI_VOLATILE,
		HAS_SYS_FILE, HAS_SYS_PARAM_H, TM_IN_SYS_TIME.
		include/krb5/configure.in does not check for these.

Fri Jun  9 18:01:26 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): CONFIG_RULES now contains the
		standardized autoconf macros which all configure.in files
		will include.  

		Removed WITH_KRB5ROOT, since it's no longer used.

		Change name of standardized Kerberos V4 #ifdef variable
		from KRB4 to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT.  KRB4 was already in use in
		the POP clients.

		Added a new macro rule, DO_SUBDIRS, which includes all of
		the MAKE_SUBDIRS macros.  This makes it easier to add
		global recursive targets to the tree.

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Thu Jun  8 17:42:40 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove excess definitions of prefix, exec_prefix,
		etc. (defined in config/pre.in)

Wed Jun  7 16:10:22 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (INSTALLMKDIRS): Make sure that the
		$(INSTALL_PREFIX) directory exists, not $(KRB5ROOT).

Tue Jun  6 12:38:12 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Build the krb524 directory.

Tue May 30 18:53:56 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: removed des425 stuff for Windows.

Fri May 26 21:45:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Export $(CC) for the benefit of config.guess

	* Makefile.in: Create kerbsrc-nt.zip with the right filename, and
		clean up include/krb5.h after making the Windows .zip files.

Fri May 26 15:33:12 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* wconfig.c: extended so it ignores lines beginning with '@'.

Fri May 26 10:16:02 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added lib/kadm and deleted lib/krb425 from PC stuff.

Thu May 25 11:30:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: don't copy profile.h here but do it in include/makefile.

Tue May 23 15:39:40 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Generate krb5.h from krb5.hin in awk-windows, for
		the Windows port.

		Added kerbsrc-nt.zip, which creates the zip file without
		the option to truncate the names to the MS-DOS 8.3
		convention. 

Tue May 16 03:05:30 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): fix rule so that MAKEFLAGS gets
		processed correctly.

Fri May  5 01:50:08 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* patchlevel.h: Update patchlevel for BETA 5 release

	* Makefile.in: Remove all files in ZIPCLEANUP after building
		kerbsrc.zip.  This keeps the source directory clean after
		building a Windows source distribution.

		Remove miscellaneous targets left over from the bad old
		imake days.

Tue May  2 21:26:09 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* .rconf: copy kadmin.old as well

	* Makefile.in: nuke spurious whitespace on blank line

Sat Apr 29 14:13:45 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_KRB4): fix so configure --help looks nice.

Fri Apr 28 15:27:45 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_KRB4): fix KDB4_LIB location when --with-krb4
		has a value.

Fri Apr 28 11:38:09 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: new windows gss app added to the zip target.

Thu Apr 27 18:30:00 1995  Keith Vetter <keithv@fusion.com>

	* Makefile.in: have ZIP exclude any *.zip files it finds.

Fri Apr 28 14:34:17 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_KRB4): put AC_CONST in, since we always end up
	needing it.

Fri Apr 28 13:28:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* configure.in: Also compile the kadmin.old directory, at least
		for now.  (At some point this should be controlled by
		--enable-old-kadmin).

Fri Apr 28 09:33:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Also remove util/profile/prof_err.[ch] after
		building kerbsrc.zip, since this also screws up the Unix
		build. 

Fri Apr 28 02:03:56 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_KRB4): fix quoting in pathname case.

Thu Apr 27 23:21:08 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Remove util/profile/profile.h after building
		kerbsrc.zip; this file screws up the Unix build.

Thu Apr 27 17:54:05 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: check KRB4_LIB to know if we're building with krb4
	support enabled and thus want kadmin.v4.

Thu Apr 27 14:00:00 1995  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: bug fix in makeing makefile on the PC.

Thu Apr 27 15:19:34 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (WITH_KRB4): make --with-krb4 the default, and have
	it use the included krb4 directories. If a pathname is given, use
	them instead. To disable krb4 support, use --without-krb4.

Wed Apr 27 11:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added stuff for new directory: util/profile. This
	   affects configuring, building, cleaning and zipping.
	* Makefile.in: added ren2long target to expand 8.3 shortened names.

Wed Apr 26 14:29:03 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (HAS_ANSI_VOLATILE): define it here for kdc and
	kadmin.old to use.

Mon Apr 24 13:30:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Fixed a PC work-around for doing a touch command.

Thu Apr 20 17:55:50 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (.ct.c): use $(RM) instead of plain rm.

Thu Apr 20 12:45:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: bug that makefiles were always being reconfigured.

Wed Apr 19 18:32:04 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: 
           removed need for this file to be configured on the PC.
           zipping up for PC copies makefile.in to makefile so that on
	   the PC you just need to type 'nmake' to build it.

Fri Apr 14 21:21:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* aclocal.m4 (_MAKE_SUBDIRS): If there is an error while making in
	        a subdirectory, abort the make in the parent directory.
	        This makes it more obvious when we have a problem in the
	        tree.

Fri Apr 14 08:23:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4 (MAKE_SUBDIRS, _MAKE_SUBDIRS): Creatre new macro
		_MAKE_SUBDIRS which works like MAKE_SUBDIRS except that it
		is possible for the target name in the parent Makefile and
		the target name which should be built in each of the
		subdirectories can be different.  MAKE_SUBDIRS is now a
		special case of _MAKE_SUBDIRS.

Fri Mar 31 21:27:13 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* aclocal.m4: Use the local autoconf when rebuilding the configure
		script. 

Tue Mar 28 18:55:12 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Fix up Mac build process somewhat.  Not complete.

Mon Mar 27 20:02:01 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added making and zipping in windows/wintel.

Wed Mar 24 14:00:00 1995  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: changed zip-windows target to kerbsrc.zip, and also
	   had the windows makefile config clean up any debugging files.

Tue Mar 22 12:00:00 1995  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: added all-mac target.

Tue Mar 22 12:00:00 1995  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: zipping up for the PC now handles trees containing
	   binary files such as *.o and *.a.

Tue Mar 21 18:50:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: oops, missed a directory in zipping up for the PC

Tue Mar 21 18:38:12 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: more PC stuff including zipping up source commands.

Sun Mar 19 12:45:08 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* aclocal.m4 (CHECK_STDARG):  Remove; we're just using AC_HEADER_CHECK.
	(V5_AC_OUTPUT_MAKEFILE):  Reorder the Makefile output so that it can be
	run through `sed' for the Macintosh.
	* acconfig.h:  Remove STDARG_PROTOTYPES.

Thu Mar 16 15:15:00 1995 Keith Vetter <keithv@fusion.com>

	* Makefile.in: added PC stuff so it builds the whole world.
	* wconfig.h: program to configure makefiles on the PC.
	* CHANGELOG -> CHANGES: renamed to avoid PC name conflict.

Tue Mar  7 19:49:07 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (UsePepsy, PepsyTarget): removed, not referenced
	anywhere in the tree.
	(ISODE_INCLUDE, ISODE_DEFS): removed along with remaining
	references in the tree. --enable-isode is dead.

Wed Mar  1 16:40:23 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* acconfig.h: Add HAS_LABS defintiion.

	* aclocal.m4 (KRB_INCLUDE): Add $(SRCTOP)/include/krb5 so that it
		builds when the build tree != the source tree.

Fri Nov 18 15:38:42 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (CHECK_WAIT_TYPE, CHECK_SIGNALS, CHECK_SETJMP,
	KRB5_UTPID, KRB5_UTTYPE, KRB5_UTHOST, KRB5_UTEXIT): use
	AC_TRY_COMPILE instead of AC_TRY_LINK.
	(CHECK_FCNTL): check for 1+O_RDONLY so we aren't fooled into

Fri Nov 18 00:31:43 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES, WITH_CPPOPTS): Add support for a new
		"--with-cppopts" value where you can put -DXXXXX such that

	* .../*.[ch]: remove rcsid, sccsid strings; punt all RCS variable
	expansions; get rid of LIBC_SCCS. Leave the BSD sccs variables in
	comments, for historical reference.

	install
	* aclocal.m4: make changes to look for install.sh in the right
	places

	errors.

Fri Jul  1 13:01:19 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4: added WITH_CC for use when CONFIG_RULES isn't safe.
	added EXTRA_RULES_IN for chosing the file that the extra rules get
	appended to (particularly for lib/krb5/asn.1).

Mon Jun 27 08:21:42 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4: fixes to do sane quoting of arguments before
	recursing.  This allows options to be set with values containing
	whitespace, for instance.

	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): move invokations of
	CONFIG_RULES around so that they preceed anything that even
	vaguely resembles a compile test.  This is so that $CC will get
	set properly before any compile tests run.

Sat Jun 25 00:33:56 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): make install will dtrt
	now (mostly)
	* configure.in (in all relevant subdirs): ditto

Thu Jun 23 01:13:20 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* aclocal.m4 (CONFIG_RULES): make --with-cc= dtrt and default to

	* Makefile.in (in all subdirs): added CC=@CC@ to nail down the
	substitution to be sure that configuration matches build. Added
	CCOPTS to some of them so that it gets nailed in correctly too.

Tue Jun 21 02:08:27 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in (in all relevant subdirs): added CCOPTS=@CCOPTS@ in
	order to allow for configured default flags
