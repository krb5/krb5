	cleanups.

	* authenc.c, main.c, utilities.c: Signed vs. unsigned cleanup.

2002-10-22  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* configure.in: Autoconf 2.55 will not simply use cpp to test for
	header file existance - the header file must be compilable. This
	will mean that if one header depends on another, it must be
	included. Test for term.h using the optional fourth argument to
	AC_CHECK_HEADERS to specify include files to test.

2002-08-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

2002-04-12  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Sepcial-case solaris+gcc to always find curses.h,
	since it fails to find it otherwise due to some macro redefinition
	warnings.

	where supplied destination is a numeric address that doesn't map
	to a hostname.

2001-09-01  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	(tn): Use get{addr,name}info instead of gethostby{name,addr}, and
	attempt to connect to both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.  Add workarounds
	for GNU libc bugs.  Fill in hostaddrstring with printable form of
	each net address.  Source routing is still IPv4-only.

	* configure.in: Run KRB5_AC_INET6.

2001-08-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* telnet.c (setupterm): Now static.

	* commands.c (call): Rewrite to use varargs/stdarg interface.

2001-07-06  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check if prototype needed for herror().

	* commands.c (ayt_status): Add explict return type (void or int)
	depending on signal handler definition. Add prototype for herror
	if system does not provide one.

2001-07-02  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* commands.c: Remove prototypes for EncryptAutoEnc(),
	EncryptAuthDec(), EcnryptDebug(), EncryptVerbose() as they exists

	a patch from Garry Zacheiss.

2000-12-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* commands.c (tn): Local var "user" should be volatile.
	* main.c (main): Local var "argp" should be volatile.

2000-11-01  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Use AC_CHECK_HEADER and AC_FUNC_VFORK instead of
	AC_HEADER_CHECK and AC_VFORK.

2000-05-11  Nalin Dahyabhai  <nalin@redhat.com>

	* commands.c (makeargv): Don't overflow buffer "saveline".

	* configure.in: Remove dependency on libdes425 when krb4 support
		is not compiled in.

2000-02-16  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	prototype for auth_cmd.

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

1999-07-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* telnet.c (telnet): Fix typo in error message, via
	schwim@whatmore.Stanford.EDU

1999-04-13    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for setupterm() in libncurses in addition to

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

1998-10-26  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* commands.c: remove calls to setuid(getuid()).  This looks like
	it was once an attempt to make it safe to run setuid, but it's not
	safe for a number of other reasons, so there's no reason to
	pretend.

Sat Oct 10 06:24:55 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* telnet.c (telnet): Cosmetic change: Put a newline after "Waiting
 	for encryption to be negotiated..." so that the response
	"[ Kerberos V5 accepts you as ``gjking@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'' ]" doesn't
 	run off the end of the line.

Mon Aug 17 04:32:08 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* main.c (main): Declare dst_realm_sz as extern int instead of
 	extern char, to agree with its definition in libtelnet/kerberos.c.
	This was causing dst_realm_sz to be zero unexpectedly, and so
	strncpy was not copying the -k realm argument into dest_realm.
	[krb5-appl/616]
	
Tue May 26 15:27:55 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Re-order check for setupterm to avoid lossage if
	setupterm is defined in libtermcap or libcurses.

1998-05-06  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* main.c (main): POSIX states that getopt returns -1 when it
		is done parsing options, not EOF.

	* configure.in: Use standard autoconf test names. Change tests
		to define standard autoconf CPP macro names, not the
		non-standard HAS_GETTOS, etc.

	* main.c, commands.c: Use HAVE_GETTOSBYNAME instead of HAS_GETTOS

	* ring.c, externs.h: Use HAVE_SYS_FILIO_H instead of FILIO_H

	prevents --without-krb4 from working for some odd reason, though
	comments says "fix post beta-6".

Wed Feb  5 22:03:35 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

Tue Nov 26 20:41:31 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@voltage-multiplier.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for apra/inet.h

	* commands.c: Remove explicit declaration of inet_addr, and
	declare INADDR_NONE to be 0xffffffff again, but mask off the lower
	32 bits while doing the compare.

Sat Nov 23 00:33:58 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* commands.c (tn): Patch from mycroft@mit.edu for Alpha NetBSD.
  	Comparing to -1 is not 64-bit clean.
 	[233]
	(INADDR_NONE): Mycroft suggests using -1 not 0xffffffff if I have
 	to define it ourselves. [233]

	Fri Nov 22 15:48:57 1996  unknown  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* commands.c (sourceroute): use sizeof instead of h_length to
 	determine number of bytes of addr to copy from DNS response
 	[krb5-misc/211]

Thu Nov 14 14:25:51 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* sys_bsd.c(intr): Added checks to intr_waiting and intr_happened
		to handle ^C while waiting for encryption negotiation.

	* telnet.c (telnet): Allow ^C to work while waiting for encryption
		negotiation to finish. [telnet/64]

 	libtelnet/auth.h to get them.

	* commands.c (forw_status): Integrate forward command from
 	jik@cam.ov.com [45]

Mon Oct 14 02:22:16 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* commands.c (env_cmd): Print only' at correct times.  Patch from
 	jhawk. [
75]
Sat Sep 21 03:47:46 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* telnet.c (telnet): Only support XDISPLOC if DISPLAY is
 	supported, thanks to jik.

	* commands.c (tn): Save away arguments before memory used by other
 	functions.  Patch thanks to jik.
	(env_init): Cannonify DISPLAY; patch thanks to jik.

	* sys_bsd.c: Use POSIX_SIGNALS when available.  This patch is
 	contribued by jik.  It could be cleaned up a bit to be more
 	consistent with Kerberos style, but is functionally correct.

Tue Sep 10 14:09:49 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* telnet.1: remove ".so man1/header.doc"
	* telnet.1: Update -x flag usage to reflect our behavior of
		dropping connection if encryption cannot be negotiated.

Sat Jul 27 21:34:22 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* telnet.c(setupterm): Only compile if setupterm not present in
        library; for Debian Linux and others, you get an endless loop
        because tcgetent is defined in terms of setupterm, and setupterm
        in telnet calls tcgetent.

	* configure.in : Check for setupterm

Mon Jun  3 21:31:37 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Ezra's patches to allow compilation w/o krb4
		support

Mon Mar 18 20:31:44 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Added flags to turn on the encryption option.

	* authenc.c (telnet_spin): Implemented the telnet spin function,
		which works by calling the Scheduler with the tty_lockout
		flag set.

	* main.c (main): If the -x option is given, set the autologin,
		wantencryption, and auth_enable_encrypt flag.  They enable
		authentication, enforcement of the encryption option, and
		a flag to the auth layer to negotiate authentication with
		mandatory encryption option.

	* telnet.c (telnet): If the wantencryption flag is set (because
		the user has given the -x option, then we enforce that
		encryption must be turned on.  The user will not be able
		to type to the network stream until encryption is enabled,
		and if encryption is refused, the client will print an
		error message.
		(Scheduler): If the tty_lockout flag is set, then don't
		process keyboard read events.  This prevents the user from
		typing over the network until encryption is enabled.

	* utilities.c (printsub): Added print support for the
		authentication must-encrypt option.

Sun Feb 25 20:32:57 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

Mon Aug  7 19:39:36 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Add authenc.c to the SRCS list; authenc.o is
		in the OBJS list, after all.

	* commands.c: rename setmode() and clearmode() to tel_setmode()
		and tel_clearmode() to avoid conflicts with setmode()
		defined in NetBSD unistd.h

	* Makefile.in: "install::" to shut up gmake


Thu Jun 15 17:41:31 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)

		change target link line to use $(LD) and associated flags.
		Also, remove DBMLIB, it was not used.

		with the Berkeley database code.  Also, add shared library
		usage check.

		for -lsocket and -lnsl with WITH_NETLIB check.

Tue Feb 28 13:28:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (install): Add $(srcdir) to install line so that
		installs work correctly when the build tree != the source
		tree. 

Wed Jan 25 18:33:41 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* telnet.1: refer to man1/tmac.doc.
	* tmac.doc: actually works with telnet.

		these routines to be a char *.

Mon Oct  3 13:28:04 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* externs.h: The proper place to look for termios.h is
