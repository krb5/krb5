1998-04-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* glob.c (ftpglob): Always allocate new storage, even if no magic
	glob characters were found, because the caller will always free
	the storage.

Tue Apr  7 16:53:58 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbyte): Set nout = 0 *before* calling
 	secure_putbuf: if the transfer is aborted, the SIGURG handler will
 	longjmp out, so the line after the secure_putbuf will never get
 	executed, so nout would never be reset and the next transfer
 	would overrun ucbuf.

Wed Feb 18 15:29:35 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

Fri Feb 13 15:31:46 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Thu Jan 29 19:39:27 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftp.h:
	* ftp.M:
	* main.c (main): add options -f (forward credentials) and -x
	(automatically negotiate encryption)

	* ftp.c (do_auth): implement -f. Also, don't complain that
	ftp/hostname doesn't exist if host/hostname does.

	* cmds.c (setpeer): implement -x

Thu Dec 11 23:26:58 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c:
	* main.c: Don't include netdb.h or sys/socket.h if krb.h is
	included; this works around an Ultrix bug where those headers
	aren't protected against multiple inclusion.

Thu Oct 16 01:20:30 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* main.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.

	* secure.c: Use <secure.h> rather than "secure.h" so that the
	correct secure.h gets included (the one in the $(srcdir) of the
	directory we're compiling secure.c into).  From danw@mit.edu.

	* ftp.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.
	Re-order the clauses so that that GSSAPI gets tried before
	KERBEROS_V4.

	* Makefile.in: Update LOCALINCLUDE and the link line to DTRT with
	krb4 compatibility.

Sun Aug 17 14:23:39 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Add $(srcdir) where needed.

Wed Apr 30 14:59:03 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

		[krb5-appl/399]

Wed Feb  5 20:29:31 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

Fri Nov 22 15:48:19 1996  unknown  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (hookup): use sizeof instead of h_length to determine
 	number of bytes of addr to copy from DNS response [krb5-misc/211]

Fri Sep 27 16:05:09 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Apply jik's fix so "-n" actually works as
	intended.


Tue Sep 10 14:07:15 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Fri Aug 16 20:04:03 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (nbyte;): Fix for Kerberos IV version of the memory
 	allocation bug I fixed for Kerberos V; you want nbyte +
 	FUDGE_FACTOR, not out_buff.length.

Tue Jul 30 19:45:45 1996  Samuel D Hartman  (hartmans@vorlon)

	* ftp.c (empt resety): Use fd_set as a typedef not a struct.
        Linux breaks.

Mon Jul 29 22:37:23 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* secure.c: Do not assume sizeof(long) = 4 for sending lengths OTW

	* configure.in: Determine sizeof short, int, long for secure.c

Fri Jul 26 20:55:12 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbyte): Reset nout to zero on errorso we
        don't overflow our buffer.

	* ftp.c (sendrequest): If there is an error in secure_write, break
        out of the loop.

	* secure.c(FUDGE_FACTOR): Define for GSSAPI so writes don't fail.
        i chose a value of 64, which is larger than the apparent 52 bytes
        of additional data but I'm not sure 52 is constant.

	(secure_putbuf): Set bufsize to the size we actually allocate
	     Also, write foure bytes for net_len no matter how long it
	     actually is.  I would rather declare it a 32-bit type but am not
	     sure whether to use the GSSAPI, krb4, or krb5 32-bit int.

Wed Jul 10 16:40:19 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* cmdtab.c (cmdtab[]), cmds.c (delete_file): rename delete() to
 	delete_file() to avoid conflict with the dbm delete() function

Thu Mar 28 21:07:40 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Define unix for HP-UX.

Thu Mar 28 19:26:53 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbuf): the size computation of the output
 	buffer was ok for krb4, but completely wrong for gssapi.  I moved
 	the code into the KERBEROS block, and wrote suitable code for
 	GSSAPI.  This affects the client and server, which were core
 	dumping on hpux.

Mon Mar 18 12:12:44 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* secure.c, ftp.c, ftp_var.h: Define STDARG if HAVE_STDARG_H is
 		defined (in addition to the other tests)

Sun Jan 14 01:54:35 1996  Bill Schoofs <wjs@cray.com>

	* Makefile.in (DEFINES): define NOCONFIDENTIAL for future use.
	* ftp.c (command): recognize 533, not 402, for 'server unwilling
	to accept' 
	(getreply): recognize 633 for confidential reply, and then don't
	support it.
	
Tue Jan  2 19:17:47 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

Wed Oct  4 19:24:39 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp, pclose, ruserpass.c, secure.c: don't ever declare malloc.

Sun Oct  1 03:30:30 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp.c (do_auth): accept ADAT 3yz response. Clean up loops, add
	lots of debugging messages.

Sun Oct  1 00:56:55 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: use FTP_BUFSIZ everywhere and make it large for
	now.
	* ftp.c: only look at "host" for now. Report error parsing
	name. Handle gssapi error reporting better.
	

Sat Sep 30 22:26:37 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp.c, secure.c: correct gssapi includes. Fix some typos and
	missing declarations.

	correct error routine.
	* getpass.c, main.c: no conf.h, use krb5_sigtype.

	VARARGS).
	(secure_error): Likewise.
