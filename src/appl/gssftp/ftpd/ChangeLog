Wed Mar 24 17:11:32 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (urgsafe_getc): New function; like getc() except it
	retries once if SIOCATMARK returns TRUE.
	(getline): Use urgsafe_getc() rather than getc() to avoid problems
	with certain Mac clients that cause the urgent pointer to end up
	in a location that results in EOF from getc().

Fri Mar 12 07:35:01 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (user): Remove extra "%s" in call to sprintf() to avoid
	dereferencing stack garbage.

Mon Mar  8 23:47:51 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Resync with reality.

	* Makefile.in (ftpd): Add libpty to link line.  Remove mention of
	logwtmp files.

	* ftpd.c: Fix up hostname logging to use
	pty_make_sane_hostname().

Thu Feb 25 23:31:37 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (reply): Don't call secure_gss_error() or secure_error()
	from within reply() to avoid setting up an infinite
	loop. [krb5-appl/684]

Thu Feb 18 18:34:23 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): Add call to setluid() if necessary.

Fri Feb 12 21:11:18 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: strcat -> strncat

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

Mon Oct 26 13:46:47 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (main): Add -A (require authentication, but not
	necessarily authorization) and -C (user wants local credentials).

	(user): Implement -A. Reorganize code a bit. If want_creds (-C) is
	set, require a password even if authorization succeeds.

	(kpass): Add krb5 ticket-getting code too. If want_creds is set,
 	don't destroy the tickets after verifying the Kerberos password.

	(pass): Check krb password before local password, so we can
	get credentials if we need them. Ignore local password if
	want_creds is set. In case of "too many failed login attempts",
	exit via dologout() instead of exit() so on-disk credentials are
	destroyed.

	(auth_data): If user forwards GSSAPI creds and want_creds is set,
	write them out to a krb5 ccache. If doing krb4 compat, convert
	them to krb4 tickets as well. (If want_creds is not set, smile and
	nod at the user and then destroy the creds.)

	(end_login): If the user has creds on disk, destroy them.
	(dologout): If the user has creds on disk, destroy them.

	* ftpd.M: Add -A and -C.
	
Fri Oct 23 18:18:52 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (pass): Wait 5 seconds before returning "password
		incorrect", and only allow three bad passwords.  Then
		return an 421 reply code before closing the connection and
		going away.

	* ftpcmd.y (cmd): Don't allow the PORT command to accept a port
		number lower than 1024; this prevents some nasty ftp
		"bounce attacks" to SMTP ports, etc.

Tue Oct 20 16:29:46 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Reality check. Add -a to synopsis, document -c and -u
	and CCC.

1998-10-08  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add support for restricted users, as requested in
	[krb5-appl/481].  Users that appear in /etc/ftpusers, followed
	by the keyword "restrict" will be granted access, but a chroot()
	will be done to their home directory.

Tue Sep 29 19:25:09 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Don't use h_errno, it's not fully portable,
		and it's not worth it.

1998-08-28  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): New function.  Essentially, the old pass
	function has been split into its two logical components, pass and
	login.  Don't reply 230 "User logged in" if the user didn't
	send a PASS command; this causes the client to get a bit confused.
	(pass): If auth_ok is true, reply with code 202 to tell the
	user that a PASS command is not necessary. 
	(auth_ok): New function that returns true if either gss_ok or
	kerb_ok is true (all the #ifdefs were beginning to clutter things,
	and it's a good abstraction in case other auth types are ever
	added in the future).
	(user): If GSSAPI or Kerberos v4 authentication succeeds, call
	login immediately, instead of waiting for the client to send "PASS
	dummy."  Also, use #ifdef PARANOID instead of "some paranoid sites
	may wish to uncomment this"

Wed Aug 19 06:47:46 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add a new command line option, -c, which tells the
	server to accept the CCC command.

	* ftpcmd.y: If the -c option was given, check to make sure the CCC
	command itself was integrity protected, and then set ccc_ok to
	allow future commands to be transmitted as cleartext.
	(getline): Now that CCC is potentially allowed, we must check to
	see if we are parsing an unprotected command even if a security
	context is established (i.e. auth_type is set).

Wed Aug 12 02:57:07 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y, ftpd.c: Replace global variable level with clevel and
 	dlevel to allow independence of command and data channel
 	protection levels.

Tue Aug 11 04:30:59 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add support for extended logging as per PR#481. Using 
	the 'l' command line option twice now logs the major file commands, 
	and using it thrice logs bytecounts for RETR and STOR as well.

Fri Aug  7 00:56:30 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Replace old KERBEROS #ifdef's with KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT
	so that K4 compatibility support actually gets compiled in.
	
	* ftpd.c: (pass): Make daemon not lose for homedirs on 
	root-squashing filesystems.
	(auth_data): Fix that godawful "error: No error" message 
	when gss_acquire_cred() fails.
	(user): Fix getusershell() code so it works more than once.

1998-07-11    <hartmans@fundsxpress.com>

	* ftpd.c (data;): do not declare h_errno; breaks on AIX and
	possibly with other multithreaded systems.

1998-05-26  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* logwtmp.c: Include paths.h if present, and use _PATH_WTMP to
		determine WTMPFILE.

Fri May  8 18:06:52 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (cmd): Fix Y2K problem in the MDTM command.

Fri Apr 10 20:06:31 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (receive_data):
	(send_data): Add support for sigsetjmp().
	(main): Use sigaction() if we can to avoid SysV lossage.
	(send_file_list): Oops missed a sigsetjmp() call.
	(send_data): Add call to secure_flush() to send a zero length
	buffer when aborting.
	(send_file_list): Add call to secure_flush() to send a zero length
	buffer when aborting.

	* ftpcmd.y (PBSZ): Remove restriction on shrinking buffer size.

Thu Mar  5 13:59:47 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (getline): Don't syslog passwords! (or newlines)

Tue Feb 24 21:34:34 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Add production "nonguest" to catch things that
	anonymous users aren't supposed to do.  Replace "check_login" with
	"nonguest" in a few places to prevent w4r3z d00dz from being
	lame with world-writable incoming directories.

Sun Feb 22 19:37:07 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Use krb5_seteuid() and krb5_setegid(). [krb5-libs/505]

	* Makefile.in (ftpd): Fix up KRB4COMPAT_LIBS (was KRB5_BASE_LIBS),
	and add UTIL_LIB.

Wed Feb 18 15:30:10 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

Fri Feb 13 22:23:34 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Applied lxs's changes to make ftpd safe for systems
		where sizeof(off_t) > sizeof(int).

Fri Feb 13 15:31:46 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (thisconfigdir), configure.in: Point the
 		configuration directory at our parent, and remove our
		local configure.in

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Fri Feb  6 13:25:28 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* popen.c (ftpd_popen): Make sure you can't overrun the argv[] and
		gargv[] arrays.  (Patch submitted by dima@best.net).

Thu Jan 29 19:51:02 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Accept forwarded credentials and dispose of
	them properly. (And fix some indentation bugs.)

Sun Dec 21 18:17:53 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* logwtmp.c (ftp_logwtmp): Rename logwtmp to ftp_logwtmp to avoid
	collision with native logwtmp.  Also, return void rather than
	int.

	* ftpd.c: Rename logwtmp to ftp_logwtmp to avoid collision with
	native logwtmp.

Thu Dec 11 23:28:07 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Don't include netdb.h or sys/socket.h if krb.h is
	included; this works around an Ultrix bug where those headers
	aren't protected against multiple inclusion.

Thu Oct 16 01:23:41 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Change LOCALINCLUDE and the link line to allow for
	krb4 compatibility.

	* ftpd.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.
	(reply): Fix up braces around the check for auth_type ==
	"KERBEROS_V4" so that the nesting of if statements is correct.
	Various and sundry fixes from danw@mit.edu to make it work.

Thu Aug 28 23:48:27 1997  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@luminous.mesas.com>

	* ftpd.c (send_file_list): Flush the data before closing it.

Thu Nov  7 15:38:51 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (ftpd_userok): Check return value of krb5_init_context()

Thu Oct 17 23:55:32 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): actually exit the for loop if the ftp key
	was ok.

Mon Oct 14 07:54:17 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (secure_fprintf): Use STDARG routines if
		present. [krb5-appl/108]

Tue Sep 10 14:07:36 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Tue Jul 23 23:13:07 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): the logic which dealt with multiple acceptor
 	names and fallback was just broken.

Wed Jul 10 16:38:01 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (store), ftpcmd.y (STOR, APPE, STOU): rename store() to
 	store_file() to avoid conflict with dbm store() function
	* ftpd.c (delete), ftpcmd.y (DELE): rename delete() to
 	delete_file() to avoid conflict with the dbm delete() function

Thu Jun 13 18:35:19 1996  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (authdata): misplaced braces caused server to not be able to
		use ftp principle if it was present.  Client looks for ftp
		first, then tries host; ftpd was looking only for host.

Mon Jun  3 16:12:59 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: back out previous changes and use
		Ezra's patches instead.

Sun Jun  2 22:08:17 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: only link getdtablesize.o if needed

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Do not fail if last gss_service is not
		present in keytab. If no services present, return a useful
		minor error status.

Fri Mar 15 01:24:39 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

        * configure.in, ftpd.c: Added shadow password support.

Sun Jan 14 02:58:42 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): call gss_release_cred on the server_creds we
	acquired, before they leave scope.

Sun Jan 14 02:47:19 1996  Karri Balk - Contractor <kbalk@cup.hp.com>

	* ftpd.c (gss_services): list of gssapi service names to try.
	(auth_data): loop over gss_services.

	* Makefile.in (DEFINES): define NOCONFIDENTIAL for future use.
	* ftpcmd.y (CCC): ditch broken CCC code, return proper 534 code.
	(PBSZ): return proper code 501 for bad PBSZ argument
	(PROT): recognize PROT E.
	(cmdtab): add CCC so as to cleanly reject it.
	(getline): reject CONF as unsupported (but put in code to
	potentially recognize it in the future.) Reject protected commands
	of auth_type isn't yet set.
	* ftpd.c (setlevel): use 536, not 504, for invalid level, and
	use levelnames to find the proper name.
	(user): if kuserok succeeds, respond 232, not 231; if it fails,
	respond 336 (though 331 might be more appropriate.)
	(auth): fix spelling error.
	
Tue Jan  2 19:19:16 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c: use HAVE_SETEUID and HAVE_SETRESUID to figure out how
	to emulate seteuid instead of assuming hpux.
	* configure.in: test for seteuid, setreuid and setresuid.

Fri Oct 20 17:17:19 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): supply correct channel bindings to accept,
	matching the client changes.

Sun Oct  1 03:31:24 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): acquire credentials (currently fixed for
	service "host".) Fix loop reply logic. Add debugging syslogs. Set
	auth_type *after* 235 success reply, so it doesn't get encrypted.

Sun Oct  1 00:58:39 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: use FTP_BUFSIZ everywhere and make it large for
	now.
	* configure.in: check for headers need to build getdtablesize.
	* ftpd.c (secure_reply): add GSSAPI hooks.
	(reply_gss_error): better gssapi error reporting.
	

Sat Sep 30 22:26:25 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c: correct gssapi includes. Fix type of client_name. Use
	gss_ok instead of kerb_ok for GSSAPI case (to simplify future
	combined code.) Fix some declarations. Fix arguments to
	gss_accept_sec_context for type.
	* ftpcmd.y: correct gssapi includes.
	
Sat Sep 30 21:40:30 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: hook setenv.c and getdtablesize.c from appl/bsd.
	Use double-colon rules for clean, depend, install.

	appl/bsd.)
	* ftpcmd.y: no conf.h. declare level. Use krb5_sigtype directly.
	* ftpd.c: use getcwd directly, make -s srvtab KERBEROS specific.
	(user): return 331 as per draft-8, but suggest 53z.
	(auth_data): return 535 and 335 and quote draft-8 as to why.
	(secure_gss_error): generic interface for secure.c functions to
	call reply_gss_error instead.

	build within the Kerberos V5 build tree.
	* ftpcmd.y, ftpd.c, secure.c: GSSAPI authentication changes based
	on the IETF CAT working group ***DRAFT*** FTP Security
	specification, draft number 8, appendix I.


**** previous change logs from CNS V4 modifications of Steve Lunt's
     draft-3 ftp daemon, which this is based on. ****

Wed Jul 26 21:03:13 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* secure.c: Include string.h.

	* ftpd.c (main): Cast signal() return value to long instead of
	int; it's more likely to fit.

	(user): If authenticate is set, reply with an error if kuserok
	fails or if no Kerberos authentication was used.
	* ftpcmd.y: Use check_login when parsing the PASV command.
	* ftpd.8: Document new -a option.

Tue Jan  3 01:25:57 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (clean): explicitly delete ftpcmd.c on clean.

Thu Dec 29 15:17:12 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpcmd.y (rcmd): don't declare atol, since it isn't used here
	anyhow, and it's a macro under linux.
	(top level): #define NBBY 8 for linux.

Thu Dec 29 14:51:41 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (statcmd): don't use NBBY check -- linux doesn't have it,
	it is in no spec, and if it isn't 8, it won't work anyway. (Use
	strcat instead of sprintf, while we're at it...)

Tue Dec 27 16:29:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* ftpcmd.y (reply, lreply): Declare if STDARG || (__STDC__ && !

	! VARARGS).
	(reply, lreply): Likewise.
	(setproctitle): Just use one argument.

	not predefine unix).

Thu Dec 22 15:05:14 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (keyfile): New global variable.
	(main): Move option processing before check of remote socket.  Add
	new options -p, -r, and -s.  Handle -p by accepting a remote
	connection.
	(kpass): Use keyfile variable rather than KEYFILE.  Pass keyfile
	explicitly to krb_rd_req.

	* ftpd.8: Document new -p, -r, and -s options.

Fri Dec 16 11:06:16 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	Fixes for HP/UX:
	* ftpd.c: On HP/UX, define seteuid and setegid as macros which
	call setresuid and setresgid.

	Fixes for UnixWare:
	* ftpd.c (main): Use a temporary variable rather than calling
	htons(ntohs(X)).
	* ftpcmd.y: Include conf.h.
	(getline): Cast arguments to Kerberos routines to avoid warnings.
	(toolong): Declare as type sigtype, and add dummy argument.

	Fixes for SCO:
	* cmdtab.y: Include <sys/types.h>.
	* ftpd.c (initgroups): Define on SCO.
	(main): Don't handle SIGURG if it is not defined.
	(pass): Don't try to use crypt on SCO; instead, require Kerberos
	password or anonymous login.

	Fixes for AIX:
	* ftpcmd.y (index): Don't define.
	(strpbrk, strcpy): Don't declare.
	* ftpd.c (index, rindex): Don't define.
	* logwtmp.c (strncpy): Don't declare.
	* secure.c: Include <netinet/in.h>.

	Fixes for Ultrix:
	* ftpd.c (main): Define LOG_NDELAY and LOG_DAEMON as zero if they
	are not already defined by <syslog.h>.

	Fixes for Irix 4:
	* ftpd.c (retrieve): Don't refer to st_blksize if NOSTBLKSIZE is
	defined.

	* ftpcmd.y: Fix yacc code to use %union and %type.
	(yylex): Assign to fields of yylval, rather than to yylval
	directly.

	General fixes to make it compile on Solaris: Use sigtype for
	signal handler return values, including conf.h where needed.  Add
	a dummy argument to signal handler functions. Replace index,
	rindex, bzero and bcopy with ANSI C functions.  Cast Kerberos
	routine arguments to avoid warnings.  Also:
	* ftpd.c: Don't include <varargs.h>.  If POSIX is defined, include
	unistd.h, otherwise define getcwd to call getwd.
	(L_SET, L_INCR): Define if not defined.
	(pwd): Use getcwd instead of getwd.  If POSIX, change the error
	handling accordingly.
	* popen.c (getdtablesize): New function on hpux or __svr4__.
	(ftpd_pclose): If WAIT_USES_INT, use int instead of union wait.
