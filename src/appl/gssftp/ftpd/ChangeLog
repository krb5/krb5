2003-06-05  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* popen.c (ftpd_popen): Use fork not vfork

2003-04-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Don't declare errno.

2003-01-03  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Kerberos v4 checksum must be a 32-bit
	value.

2002-10-23  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Bison 1.75 cleanup. Essentially remove `=' before
	statements to be executed. (ticket 1218).

2002-08-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Revert $(S)=>/ change, for Windows support.

2002-08-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Change $(S)=>/ and $(U)=>.. globally.

2002-08-23  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data, reply_gss_code): Use OM_uint32 instead of int
	to match arguments to gssapi functions.

2002-07-12  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Include port-sockets.h.

2002-06-25  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (ftpd): Don't use krb5util library.

2002-04-11  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (adata;): Don't use channel bindings in call to gss_accept

2002-03-20  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove dependency on krb524.h and krb524_err.h as
	they may not be present if compiling --without-krb4.

2002-03-05  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (unix): Define if BSD is defined.

2002-01-08  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): New argument LOGINCODE, optional result code to
	override local use of success code 230 when homedir is not
	accessible but root directory is.
	(user): Pass result code 232 to login.
	(pass): Pass result code 0 to login.

2001-11-30  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (pathname): Handle returns from ftpglob() better so
	that errors get sent via reply(), while causing some match
	failures to match to simply return $1, so the higher level can
	deal.  Previously, some failures would cause synch problems since
	NULL would be returned and no reply was sent.

2001-10-11  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Remove improper formatting from the .SH NAME section, as it
	was reported to cause windex generation problems and was inconsistent
	with all the other man pages.

2001-10-09  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd_var.h, secure.h: Make prototypes unconditional.

2001-08-03  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Update the usage line and option descriptions to be in sync
	with what the code actually does and be in a consistent order.

2001-08-03  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (main): Convert to do option parsing with getopt() rather
	than the whitespace-sensitive voodoo we've used in the past.  This
	fixes a bug where use of -u to set a default umask silently failed and
	granted more permission on files than desired if the -u and the mode
	were separated by a space, and likely many other such bugs.

2001-07-04  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Provide prototypes for myoob and lostconn. 

2001-07-03  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (sgetpwnam): Remove local declaration of sgetsave.

2001-07-02  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* popen.c: Include ftpd_var.h.

	* ftpd.c: Declare secure_fprintf, gunique, sgetsave, sgetpwnam,
	path_expand static.

	* ftpd_var.h: Add prototypes for getline, renamefrom, ftpd_popen,
	ftpd_pclose.

	* ftpcmd.y: Declare lookup, copy and urgsafe_getc static.

2001-06-22  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (help): Change local variable type to ftype.

	* ftpd.c (main): Local variable name changes to prevent shadowing
	of cp, sin, optarg.

2001-06-21  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: If NEED_SETENV defined, prototype for setenv.
	(auth_data): radix_encode expects a int * and not a size_t *. Use
	temporary variable to pass data in and out.

2001-06-20  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Include gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h for gss_krb5_copy_ccache
	prototype. Provide prototype for yyparse.

2001-06-19  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Cleanup potential ambiguity between comparsion and
	pre-increment for a variable.

2001-06-15  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y, ftpd.c: Cast argument to isspace()/isdigit() to int.

	* secure.h (SESSION): Pass pointer to C_Block as expected by
	krb5_mk_priv().

2001-06-08  Mitchell Berger  <mitchb@mit.edu>

	* pathnames.h: _PATH_FTPUSERS renamed to _PATH_FTPUSERS_DEFAULT.

	* ftpd.c: Added '-U filename' option to allow specification of
	an ftpusers file other than the default.

	* ftpd.M: Documented the new -U option.

2001-06-06  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Include "ftpd_var.h" and remove prototype for reply()
	and lreply(). Add prototypes and declare as returning void
	sizecmd(), help() and yylex(). Cleanup assignments in
	conditionals.

	* ftpd.c: Include <grp.h> for initgroups() prototype. Move
	reply(), lreply() prototypes to ftpd_var.h (and include
	same). Include "krb524.h" for krb524_convert_creds_kdc()
	prototype. Include secure.h. Provide static prototypes for
	ftpd_gss_convert_creds(), ftpd_gss_userok(), dolog(),
	receive_data(), login(), end_login(), disallowed_user(),
	restricted_user(), checkuser(). Declare main(), checkuser(),
	disallowed_user(), restricted_user(), end_login(), kpass(),
	retreive_data(), auth_data(), secure_printf(), ftpd_gss_userok(),
	as returning int. Declare setdlevel(), user(), pass(), login(),
	retreive(), store_file(), secure_error(), statfilecmd(),
	stat_cmd(), fatal(), reply(), lreply(), ack(), nack(), yyerror(),
	delete_file(), cwd(), makedir(), removedir(), pwd(), renamecmd(),
	dolog(), dologout(), passive(), perror_reply(), auth(),
	send_file_list(), reply_gss_error(), secure_gss_error(),
	ftpd_gss_convert_creds(), as returning void. Cleanup printf
	argument mismatches.

	* ftpd_var.h: New header file with many prototypes from ftpd.c.

	* popen.c (ftpd_popen): Add parenthesis in conditional to
	distinguish || vs &&. Add prototype for blkfree(). 
	(ftpd_pclose): Declare as returning int.

2001-04-25  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Don't dereference a NULL pointer returned from
	ftpglob().

	* ftpd.c: Be more paranoid about return values from ftpglob().
	Police uses of sprintf().  Account for expansion in
	radix_encode().

2001-03-07  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (strerror): Only define if not HAVE_STRERROR.

2000-12-06  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (dolog): Cast first argument to pty_make_sane_hostname to
	sockaddr pointer.

2000-10-16  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (reply): For gssapi connection, do not include NULL in
	sealed reply string.

2000-10-03  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): Return of krb5_cc_get_name is now const char *.

2000-08-25  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Fix up grammar so that single character token names
	are no longer used; this was breaking the build using bison on
	HP/UX because some system headers declare structures with members
	having all-uppercase field names and bison puts the token name
	#define statements in front of the C declarations section in the
	output, causing them to be in force while those headers get
	#included.  There doesn't seem to be much purpose in not just
	using character constants, anyway.

Tue Aug 22 11:37:35 2000  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* secure.h (myaddr): For secure data stream, pass the port number
 	of the data stream and not the control stream to krb_mk_priv.

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Iterate over all krb4 services instead of
 	trying to examine the srvtab file for a particular key (which
 	failes when falling back on the v5 keytab for des3 services).

2000-06-14  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (nonguest): Return $1, not 1, if (!guest).

2000-05-11  Nalin Dahyabhai  <nalin@redhat.com>

	* ftpd.c (gunique): Make sure that path stored in "new" isn't too long.

2000-02-18  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (reply, lreply): Declare with format attribute under
	gcc.
	(send_data, receive_data, send_file_list): Declare some variables
	volatile to protect against getting clobbered by setjmp/longjmp.
	* popen.c (ftpd_popen): Declare IOP volatile.

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

1999-09-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (checkuser): Only call fclose on file handle if it's not
	NULL.
	(send_file_list): Don't declare strpbrk function if it's defined
	as a macro.

Thu Mar 25 23:13:56 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): Check that the luid is not the uid we want to
	change to prior to calling setluid() so that we can run as
	non-root.

Wed Mar 24 17:11:32 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (urgsafe_getc): New function; like getc() except it
	retries once if SIOCATMARK returns TRUE.
	(getline): Use urgsafe_getc() rather than getc() to avoid problems
	with certain Mac clients that cause the urgent pointer to end up
	in a location that results in EOF from getc().

Fri Mar 12 07:35:01 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (user): Remove extra "%s" in call to sprintf() to avoid
	dereferencing stack garbage.

Mon Mar  8 23:47:51 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Resync with reality.

	* Makefile.in (ftpd): Add libpty to link line.  Remove mention of
	logwtmp files.

	* ftpd.c: Fix up hostname logging to use
	pty_make_sane_hostname().

Thu Feb 25 23:31:37 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (reply): Don't call secure_gss_error() or secure_error()
	from within reply() to avoid setting up an infinite
	loop. [krb5-appl/684]

Thu Feb 18 18:34:23 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): Add call to setluid() if necessary.

Fri Feb 12 21:11:18 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: strcat -> strncat

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

Mon Oct 26 13:46:47 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (main): Add -A (require authentication, but not
	necessarily authorization) and -C (user wants local credentials).

	(user): Implement -A. Reorganize code a bit. If want_creds (-C) is
	set, require a password even if authorization succeeds.

	(kpass): Add krb5 ticket-getting code too. If want_creds is set,
 	don't destroy the tickets after verifying the Kerberos password.

	(pass): Check krb password before local password, so we can
	get credentials if we need them. Ignore local password if
	want_creds is set. In case of "too many failed login attempts",
	exit via dologout() instead of exit() so on-disk credentials are
	destroyed.

	(auth_data): If user forwards GSSAPI creds and want_creds is set,
	write them out to a krb5 ccache. If doing krb4 compat, convert
	them to krb4 tickets as well. (If want_creds is not set, smile and
	nod at the user and then destroy the creds.)

	(end_login): If the user has creds on disk, destroy them.
	(dologout): If the user has creds on disk, destroy them.

	* ftpd.M: Add -A and -C.
	
Fri Oct 23 18:18:52 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (pass): Wait 5 seconds before returning "password
		incorrect", and only allow three bad passwords.  Then
		return an 421 reply code before closing the connection and
		going away.

	* ftpcmd.y (cmd): Don't allow the PORT command to accept a port
		number lower than 1024; this prevents some nasty ftp
		"bounce attacks" to SMTP ports, etc.

Tue Oct 20 16:29:46 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Reality check. Add -a to synopsis, document -c and -u
	and CCC.

1998-10-08  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add support for restricted users, as requested in
	[krb5-appl/481].  Users that appear in /etc/ftpusers, followed
	by the keyword "restrict" will be granted access, but a chroot()
	will be done to their home directory.

Tue Sep 29 19:25:09 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Don't use h_errno, it's not fully portable,
		and it's not worth it.

1998-08-28  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (login): New function.  Essentially, the old pass
	function has been split into its two logical components, pass and
	login.  Don't reply 230 "User logged in" if the user didn't
	send a PASS command; this causes the client to get a bit confused.
	(pass): If auth_ok is true, reply with code 202 to tell the
	user that a PASS command is not necessary. 
	(auth_ok): New function that returns true if either gss_ok or
	kerb_ok is true (all the #ifdefs were beginning to clutter things,
	and it's a good abstraction in case other auth types are ever
	added in the future).
	(user): If GSSAPI or Kerberos v4 authentication succeeds, call
	login immediately, instead of waiting for the client to send "PASS
	dummy."  Also, use #ifdef PARANOID instead of "some paranoid sites
	may wish to uncomment this"

Wed Aug 19 06:47:46 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add a new command line option, -c, which tells the
	server to accept the CCC command.

	* ftpcmd.y: If the -c option was given, check to make sure the CCC
	command itself was integrity protected, and then set ccc_ok to
	allow future commands to be transmitted as cleartext.
	(getline): Now that CCC is potentially allowed, we must check to
	see if we are parsing an unprotected command even if a security
	context is established (i.e. auth_type is set).

Wed Aug 12 02:57:07 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y, ftpd.c: Replace global variable level with clevel and
 	dlevel to allow independence of command and data channel
 	protection levels.

Tue Aug 11 04:30:59 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Add support for extended logging as per PR#481. Using 
	the 'l' command line option twice now logs the major file commands, 
	and using it thrice logs bytecounts for RETR and STOR as well.

Fri Aug  7 00:56:30 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Replace old KERBEROS #ifdef's with KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT
	so that K4 compatibility support actually gets compiled in.
	
	* ftpd.c: (pass): Make daemon not lose for homedirs on 
	root-squashing filesystems.
	(auth_data): Fix that godawful "error: No error" message 
	when gss_acquire_cred() fails.
	(user): Fix getusershell() code so it works more than once.

1998-07-11    <hartmans@fundsxpress.com>

	* ftpd.c (data;): do not declare h_errno; breaks on AIX and
	possibly with other multithreaded systems.

1998-05-26  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* logwtmp.c: Include paths.h if present, and use _PATH_WTMP to
		determine WTMPFILE.

Fri May  8 18:06:52 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (cmd): Fix Y2K problem in the MDTM command.

Fri Apr 10 20:06:31 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (receive_data):
	(send_data): Add support for sigsetjmp().
	(main): Use sigaction() if we can to avoid SysV lossage.
	(send_file_list): Oops missed a sigsetjmp() call.
	(send_data): Add call to secure_flush() to send a zero length
	buffer when aborting.
	(send_file_list): Add call to secure_flush() to send a zero length
	buffer when aborting.

	* ftpcmd.y (PBSZ): Remove restriction on shrinking buffer size.

Thu Mar  5 13:59:47 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y (getline): Don't syslog passwords! (or newlines)

Tue Feb 24 21:34:34 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpcmd.y: Add production "nonguest" to catch things that
	anonymous users aren't supposed to do.  Replace "check_login" with
	"nonguest" in a few places to prevent w4r3z d00dz from being
	lame with world-writable incoming directories.

Sun Feb 22 19:37:07 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Use krb5_seteuid() and krb5_setegid(). [krb5-libs/505]

	* Makefile.in (ftpd): Fix up KRB4COMPAT_LIBS (was KRB5_BASE_LIBS),
	and add UTIL_LIB.

Wed Feb 18 15:30:10 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

Fri Feb 13 22:23:34 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Applied lxs's changes to make ftpd safe for systems
		where sizeof(off_t) > sizeof(int).

Fri Feb 13 15:31:46 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (thisconfigdir), configure.in: Point the
 		configuration directory at our parent, and remove our
		local configure.in

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Fri Feb  6 13:25:28 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* popen.c (ftpd_popen): Make sure you can't overrun the argv[] and
		gargv[] arrays.  (Patch submitted by dima@best.net).

Thu Jan 29 19:51:02 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): Accept forwarded credentials and dispose of
	them properly. (And fix some indentation bugs.)

Sun Dec 21 18:17:53 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* logwtmp.c (ftp_logwtmp): Rename logwtmp to ftp_logwtmp to avoid
	collision with native logwtmp.  Also, return void rather than
	int.

	* ftpd.c: Rename logwtmp to ftp_logwtmp to avoid collision with
	native logwtmp.

Thu Dec 11 23:28:07 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c: Don't include netdb.h or sys/socket.h if krb.h is
	included; this works around an Ultrix bug where those headers
	aren't protected against multiple inclusion.

Thu Oct 16 01:23:41 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Change LOCALINCLUDE and the link line to allow for
	krb4 compatibility.

	* ftpd.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.
	(reply): Fix up braces around the check for auth_type ==
	"KERBEROS_V4" so that the nesting of if statements is correct.
	Various and sundry fixes from danw@mit.edu to make it work.

Thu Aug 28 23:48:27 1997  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@luminous.mesas.com>

	* ftpd.c (send_file_list): Flush the data before closing it.

Sun Aug 17 14:24:09 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Add $(srcdir) where needed.

Wed Jul 16 19:03:18 1997  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: Fix name of srvtab file to be krb5.keytab.

Wed Feb  5 20:34:38 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

Tue Nov 12 00:04:00 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (ftpd_userok): Don't undconditionally return -1.

Thu Nov  7 15:38:51 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (ftpd_userok): Check return value of krb5_init_context()

Thu Oct 17 23:55:32 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): actually exit the for loop if the ftp key
	was ok.

Mon Oct 14 07:54:17 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (secure_fprintf): Use STDARG routines if
		present. [krb5-appl/108]

Tue Sep 10 14:07:36 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Mon Jul 29 22:37:05 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Determine sizeof short, int, long for secure.c

Tue Jul 23 23:13:07 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (auth_data): the logic which dealt with multiple acceptor
 	names and fallback was just broken.

Wed Jul 10 16:38:01 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (store), ftpcmd.y (STOR, APPE, STOU): rename store() to
 	store_file() to avoid conflict with dbm store() function
	* ftpd.c (delete), ftpcmd.y (DELE): rename delete() to
 	delete_file() to avoid conflict with the dbm delete() function

Thu Jun 13 18:35:19 1996  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ftpd.c (authdata): misplaced braces caused server to not be able to
		use ftp principle if it was present.  Client looks for ftp
		first, then tries host; ftpd was looking only for host.

Mon Jun  3 16:12:59 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: back out previous changes and use
		Ezra's patches instead.

Sun Jun  2 22:08:17 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: only link getdtablesize.o if needed

	(PROT): recognize PROT E.
	(cmdtab): add CCC so as to cleanly reject it.

	use levelnames to find the proper name.
	(user): if kuserok succeeds, respond 232, not 231; if it fails,
	respond 336 (though 331 might be more appropriate.)

	* secure.c: Include string.h.

	* ftpd.c (main): Cast signal() return value to long instead of

Thu Dec 29 15:17:12 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpcmd.y (rcmd): don't declare atol, since it isn't used here

	(top level): #define NBBY 8 for linux.

Thu Dec 29 14:51:41 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftpd.c (statcmd): don't use NBBY check -- linux doesn't have it,
	it is in no spec, and if it isn't 8, it won't work anyway. (Use
	strcat instead of sprintf, while we're at it...)

Tue Dec 27 16:29:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* ftpcmd.y (reply, lreply): Declare if STDARG || (__STDC__ && !

	* ftpd.c (keyfile): New global variable.
	(main): Move option processing before check of remote socket.  Add
	new options -p, -r, and -s.  Handle -p by accepting a remote
	connection.

Fri Dec 16 11:06:16 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	Fixes for HP/UX:
	* ftpd.c: On HP/UX, define seteuid and setegid as macros which
	call setresuid and setresgid.

	Fixes for UnixWare:
	* ftpd.c (main): Use a temporary variable rather than calling
	htons(ntohs(X)).
	* ftpcmd.y: Include conf.h.
	(getline): Cast arguments to Kerberos routines to avoid warnings.
	(toolong): Declare as type sigtype, and add dummy argument.

	Fixes for SCO:
	* cmdtab.y: Include <sys/types.h>.
	* ftpd.c (initgroups): Define on SCO.
	(main): Don't handle SIGURG if it is not defined.

	* ftpcmd.y (index): Don't define.
	(strpbrk, strcpy): Don't declare.
	* ftpd.c (index, rindex): Don't define.
	* logwtmp.c (strncpy): Don't declare.
	* secure.c: Include <netinet/in.h>.

	Fixes for Ultrix:
	* ftpd.c (main): Define LOG_NDELAY and LOG_DAEMON as zero if they
	are not already defined by <syslog.h>.

	Fixes for Irix 4:
	* ftpd.c (retrieve): Don't refer to st_blksize if NOSTBLKSIZE is
	defined.

	* ftpcmd.y: Fix yacc code to use %union and %type.
	(yylex): Assign to fields of yylval, rather than to yylval
	directly.

	General fixes to make it compile on Solaris: Use sigtype for
	signal handler return values, including conf.h where needed.  Add
	a dummy argument to signal handler functions. Replace index,
	rindex, bzero and bcopy with ANSI C functions.  Cast Kerberos
	routine arguments to avoid warnings.  Also:
	* ftpd.c: Don't include <varargs.h>.  If POSIX is defined, include
	unistd.h, otherwise define getcwd to call getwd.
	(L_SET, L_INCR): Define if not defined.
	(pwd): Use getcwd instead of getwd.  If POSIX, change the error
	handling accordingly.
	* popen.c (getdtablesize): New function on hpux or __svr4__.
	(ftpd_pclose): If WAIT_USES_INT, use int instead of union wait.
