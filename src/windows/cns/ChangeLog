---------------------- Begin of ChangeLog from Cygnus

Fri Mar 28 15:12:28 1997  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in, cns.c, options.c: use the registry now, not an ini file.

	* cns_reg.c, cns_reg.h: registry functions.

Wed Mar 12 17:32:59 1997  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.h, passwd.c, kpasswd.c: use krb5_change_password() rather
	than rolling our own.

	* cnsres5.rc: remove forced uppercase realm name

Wed Mar  5 19:13:31 1997  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.c: Start to use init creds stuff.

Mon Nov  4 21:46:52 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.c: update name from Kerb*Net to KerbNet

	* cns.h: add length to extern character array to give the compiler
	more of a hint.

	* kpasswd.c: remove two unused variables.

	* tktlist.c: Pull definition of MAX_K_NAME_SZ from cns.h rather
	than having a local definition.

Fri Aug  9 03:41:52 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: rename executable to kerbnet.exe

	* cns.def: rename to kerbnet.def

Wed Aug  7 14:25:34 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Build kerbnet, not cns.exe
	
	* cns.c:
	* cns.h:
	* cnsres5.rc:
	* krbini.h:  Help file is kerbnet.hlp, program name is kerb*net.

	* cns.def: rename to kerbnet.def.

Sat Aug 3 13:58:20 1996  Jeff Bigler  <jcb@cygnus.com>

	* cns-help.hpj, cns-help.doc, cns-help.hlp:  added help files.
	The cns-help.hpj is a RoboHelp help project.  RoboHelp requires
	cns-help.doc, which is a Microsoft Word document, and it creates
	cns-help.hlp, which is the actual help file.

	* Makefile.in:  added line to install section to install help
	file.

Thu Jul 25 13:52:04 1996    <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* options.c (opts_command): Display a warning message when changing
	the location of the krb.conf file, since the KRB5 libraries
	will have opened it and tucked it away in krb5_context->profile,
	which we as a client don't have access to.

Wed Aug  7 18:03:16 1996  Jeff Bigler  <jcb@viola.cygnus.com>

	* kerbnet.hpj:  new help project (RoboHelp)
	* kerbnet.doc:  help file (Microsoft Word document)
	* kerbnet.hlp:  new help file (Windows help file)

Wed Jul 24 06:12:24 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Build cnsres[45].rc into executable, depending on
	if we're compiling for V4 or V5.

	* cns.rc: remove, no longer needed. cnsres[45].rc replace this,
	and allow GUI editors for editing the .rc files.

	* kpasswd.c: make this work for V5
	
	* options.c:
	* cns.c:
	* cnsres5.rc:
	* krbini.h:  Add forwardable option to options menu

Tue Jul 16 12:42:48 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* options.c:
	* password.c:  Split parts of cns.c into these files.  Each deals
	with the respective dialogs.

	* debug.c:
	* heap.c:  Added to aid in debugging.

Wed Jul 10 18:01:03 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.c: Remove the quick hacks mentioned below.

Thu Jul 25 13:52:04 1996    <explorer@lenin.cygnus.com>

	* options.c (opts_command): Display a warning message when changing
	the location of the krb.conf file, since the KRB5 libraries
	will have opened it and tucked it away in krb5_context->profile,
	which we as a client don't have access to.

Fri Jun 28 19:29:14 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.c: Really quick hacks to disable some features that just
	plain don't work correctly.  The "cns" client has some flavor of
	memory problems (malloc/free) that needs to be tracked down.

	* cnsres5.rc: reload this using a dialog editor.  Add clickbox
	for "ticket options" of "forwardable"

Wed Jun 26 14:58:23 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* cns.h kpasswd.c:  formatting change, including changing
 	// to /* */

	* Makefile.in: update some of the WIN32 entries for debugging.
	Also make resouce.obj only a dependancy for WIN32 builds.

	* cns.c tktlist.h tktlist.c:  Rewrite to use the message functions
	from <windowsx.h>, included in VC 2.0 and above.  This makes most
 	of the details of 16- vs 32-bit hidden to the code.  (Disgusting
	magic happens in <windowsx.h>)

Tue Jun 25 13:57:59 1996  Michael Graff  <explorer@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fix to work for WIN32 native compiles.  Many
	changes; some should be put into common files (win-post.in or
	windows.in?)

---------------------- End of ChangeLog from Cygnus

Wed Jan 10 23:16:41 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* cns.rc: Add an #ifdef for enabling lower case realm (for use
		with DCE).

	* cns.c (kwin_command): When obtaining tickets, we make them
		forwardable by default.  XXX This should really a
		configurable option in the UI.

Sat Jun 10 23:08:57 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* kpasswd.c: krb5_auth_context redefinitions


Mon Jun 5 14:19:51 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* kpasswd.c : Use new krb5_adm_connect() calling sequence.

Fri Jun 2 11:45:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* makefile: cleaned up and made consistent with telnet's makefile.

Tue May 30 17:28:04 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* kpasswd.c: new file for k5 password changing.
	* makefile: added new file to obj list.
	* cns.c: added call to kpasswd stuff.
	* cns.h: added prototype for kpasswd stuff.

Thu Apr 27 11:46:42 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c, cns.rc, krbini.h: K5 no longer has conf and realms files
	   but one generic config file. Changed options menu to so we can
	   specify where it lives.

Thu Apr 20 12:17:34 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c, tktlist.c, krbini.h: Fixed up #include so it
	   it only relies on krb5.h. We now include winsock 
	   ourselves and we needed to pull one constant out of
	   k5-config.h (INI_KRB_CCACHE).

Tue Apr 18 16:19:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* makefile: better compile flags.

Mon Apr 17 18:01:14 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.rc, tktlist.c: better spacing for ticket info.

Thu Apr 13 16:19:01 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c: Added better error message for incorrect password.
        * tktlist.c: flag string gets displayed within parentheses.

Fri Apr 7 15:03:10 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

        * cns.c, cns.h, cns.rc: added option dialog widget allowing user
           to specify where the ccache lives. Also, default name and realm
           is now pulled from the ccache everytime you select one.
	* cns.c: fixed memory leak in k5_dest_tkt.

Wed Apr 5 16:01:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.h, cns.rc, cns.c: GUI changes: re-order and resize
           edit boxes, add hidden button for better CR handling.
        * cns.c: used krb5_us_timeofday instead of krb5_timeofday
           for timezone/clock skew fix (not tested by tytso yet).
        * cns.c: added password changing stub with correct interface.
        * cns.def: changed kwin to cns as the name of the program.

Fri Mar 31 16:47:18 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c: realms file was not getting saved properly.

Thu Mar 30 16:11:27 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.rc, cns.h, cns.c: removed instance edit box for K5.
        * makefile: RFLAGS need version k4 or k5 set.
        * tktlist.c: also displays ticket flags.

Mon Mar 27 20:31:04 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c. cns.rc: removed debugging menu item
        * cns.c: fixed up parsing and unparsing of user name
        * makefile: removed some configuration crud
        

Wed Mar 22 16:27:48 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c: added some error checking code to catch missing realms files
