	* gss-client.c (client_establish_context): Remove OID's that
		weren't being used, and rename gss_nt_service_name to
		nt_service_name to prevent name colision.

	* gss.c (parse_name): Add code to parse an optional fourth
	 	parameter which is the mechanism OID to actually use.  If
	 	it is ommited, the default mechanism is used.

	* gss-client.c (client_establish_context): Added parameter
		oid_name, which allows the user to specify the OID that
		he/she actually wants to use to as the mechanism.

	* gss-clie.c: Renamed to gss-client.c, for VFAT/NTFS filesystems

	* makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in, so that we can do WIN16/WIN32
 		specializations.  Remove /nologo option for Win32 RFLAGS,
 		since RC apparently doesn't support it.

	* changelo: Renamed to ChangeLog, to make life easier.
