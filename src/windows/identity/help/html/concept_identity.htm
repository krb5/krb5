<h1>NetIDMgr Concepts: Identity</h1>

<p>While there are many approaches to defining what an identity is, as
far as the NetIDMgr framework is considered, an identity is the unique
security principal that is identified by a service.  Each credential
that is managed by NetIDMgr is assumed to map to a unique identity.
The collection of credentials that map to a single identity is
considered to belong to that identity.

<h3>Default Identity</h3>

<p>The default identity is the identity that will be picked up by
other applications as being the default.  For example, an application
that uses Kerberos 5 can use the credentials found in the default
Kerberos 5 credentials cache.  Therefore, the Kerberos 5 plug-in
considers the principal that corresponds to the default credentials
cache as being the default identity.
