<h1>NetIDMgr Notification Icon</h1>

<p>When NetIDMgr is running, an icon will be placed in the system
notification area (sometimes referred to as the "tray" area, or the
"system tray").  The icon will change to reflect the current state of
the managed credentials.</p>

<p>The icons and their meanings are described below:</p>

<table width="100%" border="1">

<tr>
<td><img src="images/appicon_empty.bmp" /></td>
<td>There are no managed credentials for any identity.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/appicon_good.bmp" /></td>
<td>There are valid credentials for all the identities.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/appicon_warnexp.bmp" /></td> <td>Some of the
credentials will expire in the next few minutes.  This icon will be
displayed even if automatic renewals are enabled.  In this case, the
credentials in question may get renewed before they expire, and the
icon will change to reflect this change.</td> </tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/appicon_expired.bmp" /></td>
<td>some of the managed credentials have expired.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/appicon_warning.bmp" /></td> <td>A warning
message is waiting to be displayed.  Click the icon to view the
warning message.</td> </tr>

</table>
