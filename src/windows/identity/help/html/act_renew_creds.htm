<h1>Renew Credentials</h1>

<p>The renew credentials action can be invoked via the <a
href="">Credential</a> menu or by pressing <span class="pre">Ctrl +
R</span>.  Additionally, if <span class="pre">Monitor credentials
expiration</span> option is enabled for all identities or for a
specific identity, then those credentials will be automatically
renewed before they expire.</p>

<p>An identity must be selected before invoking the renew credentials
action.</p>

<p>Not all credentials can be renewed.  The actual logic of renewing
the credentials is up to each credentials provider.  In general
NetIDMgr will invoke each credentials provider to renew their
respective credentials. For Kerberos 5, if the initial ticket is
renewable and not expired, then it will obtain a renewed initial
ticket.  For Kerberos 4, once a renewed Kerberos 5 initial ticket is
obtained, it will try to use a Krb524 translator to obtain a new
Kerberos 4 initial ticket.</p>
