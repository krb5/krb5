<h1>Starting NetIDMgr</h1>

<h3>Opening the NetIDMgr window from the notification icon</h3>

<p>Depending on how you have installed NetIDMgr, it may start as soon
as you login, or it may need to be started manually.  NetIDMgr is a
tray application.  Hence it doesn't appear on your task bar.  This is
based on the assumption that you don't need to run NetIDMgr very
often, and helps reduce clutter on the desktop.</p>

<p>When NetIDMgr is running, it places an icon in the system
notification area (sometimes referred to as the "system tray") as
shown in figure 1.  Details about the state information represented by
the icon can be found <a href="html/use_icon.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking on this icon brings up the NetIDMgr window.  Right
clicking on the icon, on the other hand, brings up a menu.</p>

<h3>Starting NetIDMgr from the Start Menu or command line</h3>

<p>If NetIDMgr was not configured to start automatically when you
login to Windows, then you need to start it either from the
commandline or the start menu.  The start menu application icon is
under "Kerberos for Windows" as shown in figure 2.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can type 'netidmgr' at a command shell to start
NetIDMgr as well.  When starting this way, you may specify additional
<a href="html/cmdline_netidmgr.htm">command line options</a>.</p>

<h3>Configuring startup options</h3>

<p>
Note that you can configure options related to the startup of NetIDMgr
by using the NetIDMgr configuration dialog box.  You can use the menu
items under the <span class="pre">Options</span> menu to invoke the
configuration dialog.
</p>

<p>
Only one instance of NetIDMgr can be running at any one time.
Attempting to start NetIDMgr while it is still running will not do
anything, unless you provide any command line options that trigger
some action in the running application instance.  If more than one
version of NetIDMgr is installed on the system, and the older version
is running at the time the newer version is started, the older version
will exit allowing the newer version to take over.
