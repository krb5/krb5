<h1>Welcome to the Network Identity Manager</h1>

<p>Network Identity Manager (NetIdMgr) is a graphical 
tool designed to simplify the management of network identities and their credentials 
which are used by network authentication protocols while providing 
secure access to network services.&nbsp; When NetIDMgr is used with Kerberos v5 each 
network identity is a unique Kerberos principal name and the credentials 
are Kerberos v5 tickets.&nbsp; Kerberos v5 tickets can be used by NetIDMgr to 
obtain Andrew File System (AFS) tokens and X.509 public key certificates if the 
appropriate plug-ins are available.</p>
<p>When you log into Microsoft Windows with a domain account, 
your account name and the Windows Domain name when combined form a Kerberos 
principal name.&nbsp; As an example, “WINDOWS\jaltman” is actually a short form 
representation of
jaltman@WINDOWS.SECURE-ENDPOINTS.COM.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows uses 
Kerberos-based network identities for all domain-based network authentications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since Microsoft Windows already provides a network 
identity, why do you need NetIdMgr?&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Your only network identity is your Windows Domain 
	account but you have third-party applications that rely on MIT Kerberos for 
	authentication for access to remote files, e-mail, web data, or other 
	services.&nbsp; In this scenario, NetIdMgr will automatically import your Windows 
	Domain credentials into a form that can be used by applications that rely on 
	MIT Kerberos.</li>
	<li>You do not have a Windows Domain account but you must 
	obtain network credentials in order to securely access a network service.&nbsp; 
	In this scenario, NetIdMgr can be used to obtain new credentials for network 
	identities and can automatically renew them before they expire.</li>
	<li>You have Kerberos credentials for a network identity 
	and you have third-party applications that require an alternative form of 
	network credential, such as an AFS token or a X.509 certificate, which can 
	be obtained via a Kerberos authentication.&nbsp; In this scenario, NetIdMgr can 
	automatically use your existing credentials to obtain and renew the 
	additional network credentials types.</li>
	<li>You have a Windows Domain account but you need to 
	authenticate to a service belonging to a Kerberos realm outside the Windows 
	Domain.&nbsp; In this scenario, NetIdMgr can be used to manage multiple network 
	identities, the Windows Domain identity as well as the additional Kerberos 
	identity required for the external network services.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>You have multiple network identities within the same 
	Kerberos realm which are used for different roles.&nbsp; For example, an 
	unprivileged user identity and a privileged identity that is only meant to 
	be used for system administration.&nbsp; In this scenario, NetIdMgr can be used 
	to obtain credentials for all of your identities and automatically renew 
	them as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>NetIdMgr’s automated credential acquisition and renewal 
makes it an invaluable tool which provides users with a Single Sign-on 
experience. </p>
<p>NetIdMgr is most commonly configured as a StartUp item that runs an icon in the Taskbar Notification Area until you logout.&nbsp; 
While running, NetIDMgr automatically renews your credentials, notifies you of 
pending expirations and prompts you when a Kerberized application requires 
credentials that have not already been obtained.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When configured to do so, NetIdMgr will prompt you 
immediately after it starts to obtain Kerberos credentials.&nbsp; This is often 
referred to as logging on to Kerberos.&nbsp; NetIdMgr does not perform a logon in the 
sense of the Windows Logon Service.&nbsp; A logon service would do more than manage 
Kerberos tickets. A logon service would authenticate you to the local machine, 
validate access to your local file system and performs additional set-up tasks. 
These are beyond the scope of NetIdMgr. NetIdMgr simply allows you to manage 
Kerberos identities on behalf of compatible applications and to change your 
Kerberos password.</p>
<p>
NetIDMgr is distributed as a part of MIT Kerberos for Windows
along with the Kerberos v5 and Kerberos v4 plug-ins.  Plug-ins for additional 
credential types including AFS tokens and KCA certificates are available as 
separate distributions.&nbsp; The OpenAFS plug-in, which is required for supporting AFS tokens, is
distributed as part of <a href="http://www.openafs.org/windows.html">OpenAFS for 
Windows</a>.&nbsp; The KCA plug-in is distributed by
<a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com/">Secure Endpoints Inc.</a></p>

<h3>Information for developers</h3>

<p>
If you are interested in developing plug-ins or extending the features
of NetIDMgr, your first stop should be the NetIDMgr SDK which is included in the 
MIT Kerberos for Windows SDK.</p>
