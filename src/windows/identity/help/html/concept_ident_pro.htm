<h1>Network Identity Manager Concepts: Identity Provider</h1>

<p>
Network Identity Manager relies on plug-ins to provide the majority 
of its functionality.  One of the requirements is that there be at 
least one plug-in that is registered as an <strong>identity provider</strong>.  The identity 
provider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>defines the identity</li>
	<li>provides the engine that drives the <i>Obtain New Credentials</i> dialog</li>
	<li>performs the initial authentication which results in a network credential that 
	    can be used in conjunction with subsequent credential providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, the identity provider plug-in that is distributed with MIT Kerberos for Windows
is Kerberos v5 based and obtains Kerberos v5 ticket granting tickets as the network credential 
that represents the identity.</p>
