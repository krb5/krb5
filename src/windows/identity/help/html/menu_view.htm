<li><a name="choosecol" /> <span class="title">View columns</span>:

Invokes a submenu from which you can choose the columns that are
displayed in the credentials window.  If you change the columns, or
their order, a new custom layout will be created for you which you can
later use using the <span class="pre">Layout</span> submenu later. For
more information about managing layouts, see the <a
href="use_layout.htm">Layout</a> topic.</li>

<li><a name="layout" /> <span class="title">Layout</span>: Opens a
submenu where you can select the layout for the credentials
display.
   <ul>

      <li><span class="title">By Identity</span>: A predefined layout
      where the credentials will be grouped by identity and by
      credentials type, in that order.</li>

      <li><span class="title">By Type</span>: <b>Not implemented in
      this release.</b> A predefined layout
      where the credentials are grouped by credentials type</li>

      <li><span class="title">By Location</span>: A predefined layout
      where the credentials are grouped by the location where they are
      stored in.  For Kerberos 5, the location is the name of the
      credentials cache in which the tickets are stored, and for AFS,
      the locatino is always the cache manager.  Individual <a
      href="concept_cred_pro.htm">credential providers</a> choose the
      interpretation of the <span class="pre">location</span> property
      as the concept of location changes from type to type.</li>

      <li><span class="title">Custom</span>: If you customize any of
      the above layouts by adding, removing, reordering or changing
      the sort or outline columns, then NetIDMgr will store your new
      layout settings under this layout.  Invoking this menu item
      restores your customizations.</ul>

</li>

<li><a name="refresh" /> <span class="title">Refresh</span>: Refresh
the credentials view.  This queries each <a
href="concept_cred_pro.htm">credential provider</a> for any
credentials and redraws the credentials view.</li>

</ul>
