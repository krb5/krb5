<h1>NetIDMgr Concepts</h1>

<p>The Network Identity manager organizes and manages your credentials
based on how they identify you to external services which use those
credentials for authentication.  To this end, it is assumed that each
credential will uniquely identify the user to a service as a single
principal or <a href="concept_identity.htm">identity</a>.  For
Kerberos, the identity is conceptually the same as the principal.
</p>

<p>At it's core, NetIDMgr does not possess any knowlege about specific
credentials that might be available for the user or how to manage
them.  It relies on several types of plugins to provide the
information it needs, and to carry out credentials management tasks.
One primary task is to identify and manage identities.  These services
are provided by a plugin called the <a
href="concept_ident_pro.htm">identity provider</a>.  Information about
individual credentials are provided by <a
href="concept_cred_pro.htm">credentials providers</a>.  Other plugins
may extend the functionaility of these plugins or provide additional
functionality for NetIDMgr.
