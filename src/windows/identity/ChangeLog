nidmgr32.dll (1.0.2.1)

- Attempting to obtain new credentials for a principal name that
  contains numbers may result in a 'Identity not specified'
  error. Fixed.

- If an invalid identity name was specified, an 'Identity not
  specified' error is reported without specifying that the cause was
  an invalid name.  Fixed: reports proper error.

- Identity names were being validated at the application layer before
  being sent to the identity provider.  This may cause valid names to
  be marked as invalid if the identity provider and the application
  disagree on what a valid name is.  Fixed: identity name validation
  is solely a function of the identity provider.

- Canonicalizing an identity name that contained certain characters
  failed due to a validation error.  Fixed.

- Possible deadlock in the new credentials dialog.  (If one plugin
  tries to synchronize custom prompter values from the plugin thread,
  while the UI thread tries to obtain a lock on the new credentials
  data, a deadlock occurs.) Fixed.

- State information for configuration panels may persist between two
  invocations of the configuration window.  Fixed to clean up state
  information properly.

- The UI library now has full support for custom actions and custom
  menus.

- When there are queued alerts and a normal alert is shown, a 'next
  alert...' button appears in the alert which lets the user view the
  next queued alert.  However, if the alert which is displayed
  requires the user to select a command button, selecting the 'next'
  button would be the equivalent of cancelling out of the alert and
  viewing the next one.  The library was updated to not show the
  'next' button if the alert requires user interaction.

- Credential renewal on half-lifes is now supported as a configurable
  option.

- Destroying all credentials on exiting netidmgr is a configurable
  option.

- Debug logging to a file has been added

netidmgr.exe (1.0.2.1)

- Selecting 'Ok' in the configuration window didn't notify all the
  configuration panels to apply the changes.  Fixed.

- PgUp / PgDn / Shift+PgUp / Shift+PgDn keys now work as expected.

- Root level configuration nodes in the Options dialog now also appear
  on the Options menu.  Configuration nodes that are registered at the
  root level are automatically added to the menu.

- The UI now has full support for custom actions and custom menus.

- The UI does not automatically add submenus for actions which are
  associated with menus unless the declaration specifies that it
  should be rendered as a submenu.

- When displaying alerts, the first button of the alert is always made
  the default.

- 'Change summary' button in the configuration dialog was removed,
  since it was unused and unnecessary.

- Ticket icons are displayed in the status column for all credentials.
  Clicking an icon opens the properties dialog for that credential.

- The UI now has View by Type functionality

- The UI now has Column selection and reorganization.  The choice
  of columns and their order are preserved between restarts.

- Handle multiple copies of NetIDMgr.exe being started with different
  version numbers.  Higher version number wins.

krb4cred.dll (1.0.2.1)

- During new credentials acquisition, under some circumstances, the
  Kerberos 4 plugin would not notify NetIDMgr about the state of the
  Kerberos 4 ticket acquisition.  This results in other plugins (such
  as AFS) which are depending on the feedback to fail.  Fixed.

krb5cred.dll (1.0.2.1)

- If no password is entered while obtaining new credentials, a new TGT
  will not be obtained, but the new credentials operation will not
  fail if there already is a TGT.  Added check to see if the TGT is
  expired and fail the operation if no valid TGT is found.

- The identity provider can set the Krb5 CCName property for an
  identity incorrectly if there is more than one credential cache
  containing tickets for the same principal.  Fixed.

- When enumerating ccaches, krb5_cc_resolve was being called with the
  name of the ccache without a type prefix.  Fixed.

- Tracker control usability issues due to loss of focus. Fixed.

- Realm Editor added.

- Addressed tickets can be requested as in Leash


All modules:

- removed grayed out UI components that are not being backed
  by current functionality.

- new icons

- support for 64-bit Windows builds under Visual Studio 8

- proper versioning for language resources
