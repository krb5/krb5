Wed Feb  5 22:22:24 1997  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed win16 linking of telnet.exe
	* encrypt.c: Do not use printf; use MessageBox and OutputDebugString
	* encrypt.h: Fixed des425 library prototypes (win16)
	* telnet.c: Removed ^M at end of every line

Wed Jun 12 00:22:02 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in, so that we can do WIN16/WIN32
 		specializations.  Remove /nologo option for Win32 RFLAGS,
 		since RC apparently doesn't support it.

	* changelo: Renamed to ChangeLog, to make life easier.

Fri Jan 19 23:22:12 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* auth.c (k5_auth_send): krb5_get_credentials does not take the
		kdc_options flags. 

Tue Sep 26 20:11:18 1995    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* auth.c: Don't include los-proto.h; it's no longer present.
		Don't include des-int.h; it's no longer needed.

Sat Jun 10 23:09:20 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* auth.c: krb5_auth_context redefinitions

Fri Jun 2 10:51:31 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)
	
	Added cursor keys (in two modes) and ctrl-space: the arrow 
	 keys get sent as escape sequences. The actual sequence depends
	 on the keypad mode which emacs exploits.
	 Also, ctrl-space now sends a null (for the emacs fans).

	* emul.c: enabled calls to ScreenSetOption to change keyboard modes.
	* intern.c: enabled ScreenSetOption but in a limited fashion.
	* screen.c: cursor keys now get sent to the host machine.
	* screen.h: Added prototype for ScreenSetOption and a new message
	   type WM_MYCURSORKEY for handling the cursor keys.
	* telnet.c: handles WM_MYCURSORKEY and ctrl-space, plus a bug
	   fix on cancelling from the menu on the opening dialog.
	* makefile: cleaned up and made consistent with the cns makefile.

Thu May 25 12:52:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* auth.c, intern.c, negotiat.c, screen.c, screen.h, telnet.c,
	   telnet.h, changelo: forgot to specify DOS eol when unzipped
 	   on Unix so had to remove the extra blank lines.

Thu May 25 11:26:14 1995 John Rivlin  <jrvlin@fusion.com>

	* emul.c - make the eol wrapping to work properly. This fixed 
	   numerous seemingly unrelated scrolling bugs.
	* auth.c, intern.c, negotiat.c, screen.c, screen.h, telnet.c
	   telnet.h: removed level of indirection by using pointers rather
 	   than handles; also cleaned up the formatting.

Thu Apr 27 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  <jrvlin@fusion.com>

	* edit.c, emul.c, font.c, intern.c, screen.c, telnet.c, screen.h
	struct.h, telnet.h, wt-proto.h
	Clean up code extensively:
		Change memory management to use calloc rather than locking
		and unlocking handles everywhere.  This makes the code
		much easier to understand and maintain.

		Add assertions

		Remove unused global values and scope global values
		appropriately to remove accidental overlays of liked
		name values (like hInst)

		Make code formatting uniform and remove dead code.

	* screen.c (InitNewScreen, ScreenWndProc): Rearranged window
	creation order to so that SCREEN_HANDLE gets set up at the 
	beginning of the window creation.  Thus we can create the 
	window in the correct size and shape prior to showing it,
	eliminating a resize after the window is shown.

Tue Apr 18 17:11:56 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* telnet.c: bug fix with saving/restoring delete versus backspace.

Fri Apr 7 15:14:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* telnet.c, wt-proto.h: port numbers better supported. You can
           now specify '<host> <port>' in the initial dialog. This gets
           saved in the ini file.

Wed Apr 5 16:18:30 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* screen.c, screen.h, dialog.h, telnet.rc: added an about 
           box with version number.

Fri Mar 31 16:24:52 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* telnet.c, wt-proto.h: added command line option to set port number
           so port is no longer wired to 13131.
        * auth.c: made the k4/k5 separation cleaner

Mon Mar 27 20:18:41 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Initial release based upon the K4 version. 
        * K4 streams layer is replaced with no-ops in k5stream.c
        * only one-way authentication tested since a telnet daemon which
           does mutual is not available.
        * connect port is hard-wired to 13131 for now since that is the
           port of the only available K5 telnet daemon (tsx-11.mit.edu)
