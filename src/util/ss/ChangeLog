Mon Aug  7 19:14:28 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (mk_cmds): Add $(SHELL) to invocation of
		config_script, so that the tree can build even after
		checked into a broken SCCS system.

Fri Jul 7 16:42:42 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add symlink to $(TOPLIBD) for libss.

Wed Jun 28 16:35:43 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in, ct_c_sed.in, ct_c_awk.in: Rename ct_c.*.in to
		ct_c_*.in, so that the sources will unpack cleanly under
		DOS.  Argh.

Wed Jun 28 11:24:20 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, ct_c.sed.in, ct_c.awk.in, config_script: Rename
		ct_c.* to ct_c.*.in.  ct_c.sed.in is now processed by sed
		to remove comment lines beginning with '#', since some sed
		programs can't handle that.  Change config_script so that
		the directory where the ct_c.* files can be specified,
		since those are in the build directory, instead of the
		source directory.  (This is all for the sake of System V
		sed's.  Sigh.)

Tue Jun 27 15:46:06 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* listen.c(listen_int_handler) - Add argument to conform to signal
		handler prototype.

Tue Jun 13 01:48:33 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: don't install libss.a

Fri Jun  9 19:00:11 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Fri Jun  9 06:20:37 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* error.c (ss_error): remove const declaration from local
		variable. (it is used with free is called on the contents).

	* ss_internal.h: Include stdlib.h if present on system. If is
	present, don't redeclare malloc.

	* configure.in: Check for stdlib.h before including blindly.

Thu Jun  8 23:22:07 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* list_req.c, ss_internal.h: Clean up -Wall flames.

	* configure.in: Don't install the internal ss include files.

Thu Jun  8 22:54:16 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* mk_cmds.c (main): Change mk_cmds so that the output file is
		always created in the current directory, instead of in the
		directory where the source file is located.

Thu Jun  8 11:27:47 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't install in this directory.

Thu Apr 27 12:26:26 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* pager.c: Use posix signals.

	* listen.c: Use posix signals.

	* list_rqs.c: Use posix signals.

	* help.c: Call wait with proper casting (int * vs. union wait *)

	* configure.in: Add AC_PROG_ARCHIVE_ADD and CHECK_SIGNALS.

	* Makefile.in (all): Use ARADD for incremental changes to library

Tue Mar 28 18:51:08 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (all):  Run all-$(WHAT).
	(unixmac):  Build includes at this time.
	(LDFLAGS):  Punt duplicated setting.

Sat Mar 18 18:49:03 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* configure.in:  Use AC_CHECK_HEADERS(stdarg.h), not CHECK_STDARG.
	* error.c:  Use HAVE_STDARG_H, not STDARG_PROTOTYPES.

Mon Feb 27 22:40:18 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid recompilation of std_rqs.c every single time
	`make' is run.
	* error.c:  Use "com_err.h", not <com_err.h>.

Thu Feb 23 14:24:31 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* mk_cmds.sh: use ${SED} not sed in backtick expressions.
	Explicitly check for ${FILE} since sed doesn't give an error if it
	is absent. Also set -e to catch other conditions.

Sat Oct 22 09:54:50 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* list_rqs.c (ss_list_requests): 
	* listen.c (ss_listen): 
	* configure.in: Add AC_RETSIGTYPE to get proper return type for
		signal hanlders.

Fri Oct 21 21:07:16 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in (SED): Don't specify an explicit pathname for sed.

Tue Oct 11 12:41:40 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Don't rm the awk and sed scripts during a make clean!

Fri Oct  7 15:37:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* ct_c.sed: Add extra check to make sure blank lines get squeezed
		out.  Needed for AIX's sed, for some reason.

Thu Oct  6 19:40:09 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* mk_cmds.sh -- replace basename with sed -- more portable

Mon Oct  3 17:26:27 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in:
	  configure.in:  Don't try to compile mk_cmds.  Use awk/sed shell
	  	  script replacement instead.  It's more apt to be
		  portable, since it doesn't use lex or yacc.  :-(

Tue Aug 30 21:30:18 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* cmd_tbl.lex.l: Add declaration for strdup() if HAS_STRDUP is not
	defined. 

	* ct.y: Added #include of string.h; added declaration for
	strdup() if HAS_STRDUP is not defined.

Tue Jul 19 20:27:59 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: remove spurious includes rules

Wed Jul 13 23:20:44 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: nuke libss.a.bak crud

Sun Jul  3 07:48:43 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: changing things to now spew ignored errors.

Wed Jun 22 18:51:50 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: ss_err.h is *not* a SrcHeader. Note that there is
	duplication between the Copy*Header lines and the includes: rule
	in the Makefile.in, which should later be fixed.

Tue Jun 21 00:21:05 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: should be CopySrcHeader

Mon Jun 20 21:58:40 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: install headers during build
