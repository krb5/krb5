Mon Oct  2 11:16:32 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (V5_MAKE_SHARED_LIB): Add version number 0.1 for
		library creation. 

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove DONE

Mon Sep 25 16:41:50 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Wed Sep 20 12:00:00 1995	James Mattly <mattly@fusion.com>

	* com_err.c:  Mac UI improvements, added a hilite arround the default button,
		also made the window respond to enter, return, and escape keys.

Fri Sep 22 19:58:22 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* error_message.c (sys_nerr): Only define sys_nerr if we're on a
		Macintosh.  On those systems which use sys_nerr, it's an
		external variable, defined by libc.  Under Windows, it's
		apparently an cpp macro.

Mon Aug  7 19:22:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (compile_et): Add $(SHELL) to invocation of
		config_script, so that the tree can build even after
		checked into a broken SCCS system.

Thu Jul 13 15:40:56 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* com_err.h: error_message should be const char * (as it is in
        error_message.c), not char const * (as currently presented).

Alspo, since error_message
ets declared const even on non-ansi compilers, set the return type that way so AIX cc doesn't barf.	

Wed Jul 12 12:37:24 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* error_message.c: Do not include stdlib.h unless it exists

Fri Jul 7 16:42:20 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add DEPLIBS, needed by shared library rule.

Wed July  5 15:52:31 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>
	* com_err.[ch] added _MACINTOSH conditional
	* vsprintf.h added inclusion of stdarg.h for _MACINTSOH

Fri Jun 23 20:08:16 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: fix typo; appended "all" rule needs two colons to
		keep gmake from breaking.

Thu Jun 22 16:14:25 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* error_table.h: reverse sense of KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES

Fri Jun 23 10:50:14 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Change "./done" and "done" to DONE.  Shared library
		script requires "DONE".

Thu Jun 22 13:06:47 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in Changed libcom_err.a to libcom_err.$(STEXT), removed rule to clean it up on Unix as aclocal.m4 already inserts the rule.  If this breaks on Macs, please let me know how I should do this in the future.

	* configure.in: Changed to make libcom_err as a shared library.

Fri Jun  9 19:00:05 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Thu Jun  8 11:26:09 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't install compile_et.1; we're not
		installing the program, anyway.

Tue Jun  6 19:45:34 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in: fix make install

Fri Jun 2 18:05:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* error_message.c: better handling of Winsock errors.

Tue May  2 21:35:09 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: remove spurious whitespace from blank line

Fri Apr 14 08:48:00 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* com_err.h: If FAR is not defined, define it away.

Thu Apr 13 16:02:24 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

        * com_err.c, compile_et.c, error_ta.h, et_c.awk, internal.h:
           __STDC__ conditionals also checks for the _WINDOWS define.

Wed Apr 5 16:25:35 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.h: added FAR to pointers in prototypes.

Wed Mar 29 08:56:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Fix up Mac makefile.
	* error_message.c:  For errno, use strerror if HAS_STRERROR.
	* configure.in:  Define HAS_STRERROR.

Thu Mar 23 19:00:03 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* com_err.c (default_com_err_proc): Fixed breakage introduced by
		windows port.  com_err() is supposed to print a newline at
		after printing the error message!

Wed Mar 22 11:34:09 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: added _WINDOWS equivalent condition to HAVE_STDARG_H
 	   since windows fakes autoconf by defining such constants in
	   k5-config.h which isn't included for this file.

Thu Mar 16 19:57:20 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: added missing INTERFACE on a prototype.
        * com_err.h: added _WINDOWS as an equivalent to __STDC__ since this
           file gets included by windows programs in which __STDC__ isn't defined.
        * makefile.in: added xxx-mac targets to mimic xxx-unix, and added
            copying com_err.h to src\include for the PC.

Wed Mar 16 17:30:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.h: problem with this file needing k5-config for windows
	   stuff but many application programs don't include it. So for
	   now I've put the windows stuff that is needed directly into it.

Wed Mar 15 23:02:14 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* com_err.c: made to work on the PC. Biggest changes was that
           the error message now gets built in a buffer and either gets
           printed to stderr or for Windows gets displays in a message box.
        * err_message.c: fixed up includes and some 32/16 bit ints.
        * et_name.c: changed two ints into longs.
        * com_err.h: added windows keyword INTERFACE to prototypes.
        * error_table.h: Added some windows specific defines since this
           source doesn't really know about k5-config.h. Also, added 
           prototype for error_table_name().
	* Makefile.in: PC rules to make com_err, err_message and et_name.

Tue Feb 28 13:23:58 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* error_table.h: Remove #ifdef STDC check to see if we should use
		const --- configure takes care of this.

Tue Feb 28 01:35:14 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* com_err.3:  Document "com_err.h" rather than <com_err.h>.

Fri Feb  3 08:11:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* com_err.h: All routines defined in the com_err library should
		have extern before the prototypes.   (Required for SGI
		platform).

Wed Jan 25 20:48:50 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): add com_err.c explicit dependency to work
	around VPATH bug in Solaris make. Also fix typo in comment.

Fri Nov 18 00:34:29 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: add caching to perror check (from epeisach).

Fri Oct 21 21:06:48 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in (SED): Don't specify an explicit pathname for sed.

Tue Oct 11 12:43:00 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Don't rm the awk and sed scripts during a make clean!

Thu Oct  6 19:39:11 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* compile_et.sh: Replace basename with sed -- more portable.

Mon Oct  3 17:27:28 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in:
	  configure.in: Don't try to compile compile_et.  Use awk/sed
	  	  version instead.  It's more apt to be portable, since it
		  doesn't use awk or sed.  :-(
	

Fri Sep 30 17:12:15 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* compile_et.c: Add declaration of error_message() manually.

	* internal.h: Use autoconf to determine whether or not to declare
		perror().

	* configure.in:
	  compiler.h:
	  internal.h:
	  compilet_et.c:
	  init_et.c: Let configure take care of removing const with AC_CONST.

Thu Sep  8 22:33:07 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@pinata)

	* com_err.c (default_com_err_proc): Reversed order of \n\r to make
		jik happy.

Wed Jul 13 23:19:34 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: nuke the libcom_err.a.bak stuff

Sun Jul  3 07:48:04 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: cleaning up to not spew ignored errors

Wed Jun 22 18:47:36 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* com_err.h: Only set STDARG_PROTOTYPES based on STDC if it isn't
	set already (clean up warnings.)

Wed Jun 22 17:55:48 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (CP): set CP so CopySrcHeader actually works.

Tue Jun 21 00:20:44 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: add "includes" to "all" dependencies

	* configure.in: should be CopySrcHeader

Mon Jun 20 21:59:37 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu at dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: install com_err.h during build
