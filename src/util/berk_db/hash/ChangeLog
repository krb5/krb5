	* configure.in: use AC_CHECK_FUNCS and check for memmove.
	hash.h: if we don't HAVE_MEMMOVE use bcopy.

	* configure.in: *int*_t are likely to collide with native types,
	and the int8_t and *int64_t are never used anyway, so push them
	off to hash/configure.in AC_CHECK_TYPE calls. pgno_t also.

	* hash.c - Cast 2nd argument to memmove to (char *).

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

	* configure.in (CDEFS_INCLUDE): /bin/sh doesn't grok $(foo); it
		wants ${foo}!

Tue May 30 10:41:23 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in: Check for sys/cdefs.h.
	* Makefile.in: If sys/cdefs.h present, don't use the one in PORT/krb5.

	* krb5_ndbm.c: If the size field of datum and DBT do not match,
		then passing structures subject to stack garbage. Copy
		instaead.

		fields.
