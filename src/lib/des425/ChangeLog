Tue Jun 27 23:17:11 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* read_passwd.c: only use volatile if __STDC__ is 1.

Tue Jun 27 15:51:10 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* util.c - Make #endif ansi-compliant.
	* read_passwd.c - Add signal name parameter to signal handler to
		conform to prototype.

Mon Jun 26 14:39:18 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Removed bogus -g.  It breaks on shared
        links when you're actually calling ld not cc.

Fri Jun 23 18:16:09 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: fix Sam's typo so libdes425.a gets symlinked
		properly.

Fri Jun 23 12:45:43 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: New static library targets.

	* Makefile.in : Add new static library target handling.

Fri Jun 16 17:00:04 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* k4_glue.c - Add this module with the "req_act_vno" symbol definition
		so that we can use old versions of K4.
	* configure.in - Check for #pragma weak.
	* Makefile.in - Add k4_glue.c, Add K4 to include list.

Fri Jun 16 11:15:11 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add install target for shared library.


Thu Jun 15 18:00:45 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Change "./DONE" target to "DONE" since we have a rule
		for how to build it.  Also add definitions for shared library
		building rules.
	* configure.in - Create symlinks for archive and shared library when
		we build them.

Wed Jun 14 07:37:26 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (libdes425.a): Don't copy library up a level. Let
		above Makefile symlink to it.

Fri Jun  9 19:18:59 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Thu Jun  8 23:24:20 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* read_passwd.c (des_read_pw_string): Don't depend on
		krb5_read_password(); this created a circular dependency
		in the libraries.  This code is now duplicated in
		des_read_pw_string.

	* util.c (des_cblock_print_file): Fix -Wall nit.

Mon Jun  5 21:02:37 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* quad_cksum: Convert longs to KRB_INT32 for 64 bit platforms.

Fri May 26 21:43:52 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* util.c: Added new function, des_cblock_print_file(), which is
		referenced by libkrb4.a.  (Even though it's never used,
		some OS's demand that all of the references in a
		shared library have to be resolved.)

Mon May  1 11:29:37 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* read_passwd.c: (des_read_pw_string): Call to krb5_read_password
		wants a pointer to the length of the buffer.

Fri Apr 28 13:35:25 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* read_passwd.c (des_read_pw_string): Add des_read_pw_string,
		since it's used by the V4 login.c code.

Thu Apr 13 15:49:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* *.[ch]: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.

Wed Mar 22 11:21:38 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* read_passwd.c: changed return value to krb5_error_code
        * des.h: same as above
        * unix_time.c: didn't work on the PC. Copied PC time code from 
           krb5\os\ustime.c.

Mon Mar 20 21:14:40 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in, unix_time.c(unix_time_gmt_unixsec): Added function
		needed for des425 to work with the Cygnus krb.a.

Wed Mar 15 13:44:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* des.h: now includes des_int.h for proper prototypes.
	* enc_dec.c: cast the types of the input/output buffers in calling
           the encrypt routine.
	* key_sched.c: removed prototype of a non-existent routine.
	* new_rnd_key.c: removed prototypes in the file and instead include
           header file with the real prototypes.
	* random_key.c: code, as it was, could never have worked. Adding 
           prototypes revealed that it was passing KEY with the wrong level
           of indirection.
        
Tue Mar 7 19:57:28 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* pcbc_enc.c: added casts on the long->char assignments.
        * str_to_key.c: converted int->long to match types.


Wed Mar  8 17:13:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (clean): Dete verify.o on a "make clean".

Wed Mar  1 17:57:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* verify.c: Remove declaration of exit().

Tue Feb 28 01:30:11 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* cksum.c, des.c, des.h, enc_dec.c, pcbc_encrypt.c, quad_cksum.c,
	read_passwd.c, string2key.c, weak_key.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Tue Feb 21 17:42:44 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

        * Makefile.in: made to work on the PC
	* *.c, des.h: added windows INTERFACE keyword
        * read_passwd.c: renamed a static variable to avoid compiler error
        * quad_cksum.c: errno extern declaration removed on the PC

Fri Feb  3 17:23:45 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* pcbc_encrypt.c: Add SIZEOF_FOO checks to properly define
		  KRB_INT32

Wed Jan 18 15:12:18 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* read_passwd.c (des_read_password): Declare global_context and
		initialize it if necessary.

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Thu Nov  3 18:29:10 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* pcbc_encrypt.c: moved from f_pcbc.c in lib/crypto/des, and
	inlined proper des.h to avoid confusion in names.
	* Makefile.in: add -I to CFLAGS to get f_tables.h from
	lib/crypto/des as well.

Wed Oct 26 14:23:36 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in (check): 
	* verify.c (main): Add verification checks to the test suite.

Wed Oct 19 12:16:13 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR) completely

Mon Oct  3 22:48:14 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: make install obey $(DESTDIR)

Thu Aug  4 03:40:55 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* configure.in: oops look for install program

	* Makefile.in: make install fixes
