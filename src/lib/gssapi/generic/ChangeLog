Sat Feb 24 21:30:53 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapi.h (GSS_S_DUPLICATE_ELEMENT): New error code function.

		draft once it is issued.

Wed Jan 24 20:48:15 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* gssapi.h: Added definition of NPROTOTYPE to dtrt with Ultrix,
		etc.  Also added special case for Ultrix (limited
		prototype support).

Tue Jan 23 03:28:41 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Removed prototypes of functions that have
		been moved to the mechglue layer.

	* Makefile.in: Removed gssapi_generic.c, oid_ops.c, rel_buffer.c,
		and rel_oid_set.c --- these functions are now done in the
		mechglue layer.  

Wed Jan 10 21:31:42 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (gssapi_err_generic.$(OBJEXT)): Added ##DOS
		statements after gssapi_err_generic.$(OBJECT) to get it
		added to library on Windows.  (Patch from Doug Engbert).

	* gssapi.h: Remove #if statement that used sizeof(xxx), since that
		won't work for most C compilers/C preprocessors!

Thu Jan  4 21:33:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapiP_generic.h (TWRITE_INT16, TREAD_INT16): Added new macros
		to read and write two byte integers from the wire.

		size_t is defined.

Fri Oct  6 22:01:57 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.

Fri Sep 29 02:02:35 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* gssapi.h: For MS-DOS, use the brute force method of defining the
		size of variables; we should really get an autoconf file
		for MS-DOS.

Mon Sep 28 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com>
	
	* gssapi_generic.h: Modified to use build in compiler symbols rather
		than relying on _MACINTOSH so the projects can include the file
		without using our headers.

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Mon Sep 25 16:53:00 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

		also we don't have limits.h


Thu Aug 31 11:43:59 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* gssapi.h - Update to V2 API.  Also use autoconf.h if USE_AUTOCONF_H
		is defined, otherwise resort to brute force.  Remove const_
		gss_OID, as it's not defined in the API.
	* gssapiP_generic.h - Add new V2 dispatch prototypes.  Update
		arguments to be compatible with V2 API.
	* disp_major_status.c - Describe new failure codes.  Update argument.

		conditionally k5-sockets.h.


Fri Jul 7 16:22:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove LDFLAGS, it's set by configure.

Fri Jun  9 19:25:47 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Wed May 24 06:52:41 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* gssapiP_generic.h: Include k5-sockets.h now that k5-config.h
		does not include netdb.h.

Mon May 22 10:08:13 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- Install EXPORTED_HEADERS in gssapi subdirectory of
			  KRB5_INCDIR.

Thu Apr 20 14:23:14 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

Thu Apr 20 11:41:04 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Add checking for SIZEOF_SHORT, SIZEOF_INT, and
		SIZEOF_LONG, so we don't need to depend on getting this
		information from include/krb5/autoconf.h

	* gssapi.h: Removed dependence on krb5 include files.

	* gssapiP_generic.h: We need to include k5-config in order to get
		Windows specific hackery.  Somewhat of a wart, but this is
		a gssapi internal header file, so the rest of the world
		doesn't have to see this.

	* util_token.c: Define VALID_INT, instead of relying on this being
		defined by krb5.h.

Thu Apr 13 16:27:56 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

          added INTERFACE to prototypes.

Mon Feb 20 12:00:00 1994  Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)
