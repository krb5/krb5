1. Abstract

   This note describes the MD4 message digest algorithm.  The algorithm
   takes as input an input message of arbitrary length and produces as
   output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.  It
   is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two
   messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message
   having a given prespecified target message digest.  The MD4 algorithm
   is thus ideal for digital signature applications, where a large file
   must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being signed with the
   RSA public-key cryptosystem.

   The MD4 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines.
   On a SUN Sparc station, MD4 runs at 1,450,000 bytes/second.  On a DEC
   MicroVax II, MD4 runs at approximately 70,000 bytes/second.  On a
   20MHz 80286, MD4 runs at approximately 32,000 bytes/second.  In
   addition, the MD4 algorithm does not require any large substitution
   tables; the algorithm can be coded quite compactly.

   The MD4 algorithm is being placed in the public domain for review and
   possible adoption as a standard.

   (Note: The document supersedes an earlier draft.  The algorithm
   described here is a slight modification of the one described in the
   draft.)

2.  Terminology and Notation

   In this note a "word" is a 32-bit quantity and a byte is an 8-bit
   quantity.  A sequence of bits can be interpreted in a natural manner
   as a sequence of bytes, where each consecutive group of 8 bits is
   interpreted as a byte with the high-order (most significant) bit of
   each byte listed first.  Similarly, a sequence of bytes can be
   interpreted as a sequence of 32-bit words, where each consecutive
   group of 4 bytes is interpreted as a word with the low-order (least
   significant) byte given first.

   Let x_i denote "x sub i".  If the subscript is an expression, we
   surround it in braces, as in x_{i+1}.  Similarly, we use ^ for
   superscripts (exponentiation), so that x^i denotes x to the i-th
   power.

   Let the symbol "+" denote addition of words (i.e., modulo- 2^32
   addition). Let X <<< s denote the 32-bit value obtained by circularly
   shifting (rotating) X left by s bit positions.  Let not(X) denote the
   bit-wise complement of X, and let X v Y denote the bit-wise OR of X
   and Y.  Let X xor Y denote the bit-wise XOR of X and Y, and let XY
   denote the bit-wise AND of X and Y.

3.  MD4 Algorithm Description

   We begin by supposing that we have a b-bit message as input, and that
   we wish to find its message digest.  Here b is an arbitrary
   nonnegative integer; b may be zero, it need not be a multiple of 8,
   and it may be arbitrarily large.  We imagine the bits of the message
   written down as follows:

                m_0 m_1 ... m_{b-1} .

   The following five steps are performed to compute the message digest
   of the message.

      Step 1. Append padding bits

         The message is "padded" (extended) so that its length (in bits)
         is congruent to 448, modulo 512.  That is, the message is
         extended so that it is just 64 bits shy of being a multiple of
         512 bits long.  Padding is always performed, even if the length
         of the message is already congruent to 448, modulo 512 (in
         which case 512 bits of padding are added).



Rivest                                                          [Page 2]

RFC 1186              MD4 Message Digest Algorithm          October 1990


         Padding is performed as follows: a single "1" bit is appended
         to the message, and then enough zero bits are appended so that
         the length in bits of the padded message becomes congruent to
         448, modulo 512.

      Step 2. Append length

         A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before
         the padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the
         previous step.  In the unlikely event that b is greater than
         2^64, then only the low-order 64 bits of b are used.  (These
         bits are appended as two 32-bit words and appended low-order
         word first in accordance with the previous conventions.)

         At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits
         and with b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits.
         Equivalently, this message has a length that is an exact
         multiple of 16 (32-bit) words.  Let M[0 ... N-1] denote the
         words of the resulting message, where N is a multiple of 16.

      Step 3. Initialize MD buffer

         A 4-word buffer (A,B,C,D) is used to compute the message
         digest.  Here each of A,B,C,D are 32-bit registers.  These
         registers are initialized to the following values in
         hexadecimal, low-order bytes first):

            word A:    01 23 45 67
            word B:    89 ab cd ef
            word C:    fe dc ba 98
            word D:    76 54 32 10

      Step 4. Process message in 16-word blocks

         We first define three auxiliary functions that each take
         as input three 32-bit words and produce as output one
         32-bit word.

            f(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v not(X)Z
            g(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v XZ v YZ
            h(X,Y,Z)  =  X xor Y xor Z

         In each bit position f acts as a conditional: if x then y else
         z.  (The function f could have been defined using + instead of
         v since XY and not(X)Z will never have 1's in the same bit
         position.)  In each bit position g acts as a majority function:
         if at least two of x, y, z are on, then g has a one in that bit
         position, else g has a zero. It is interesting to note that if



Rivest                                                          [Page 3]

         the bits of X, Y, and Z are independent and unbiased, the each
         bit of f(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased, and similarly
         each bit of g(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased.  The
         function h is the bit-wise "xor" or "parity" function; it has
         properties similar to those of f and g.

         Do the following:

         For i = 0 to N/16-1 do  /* process each 16-word block */
                 For j = 0 to 15 do: /* copy block i into X */
                   Set X[j] to M[i*16+j].
                 end /* of loop on j */
                 Save A as AA, B as BB, C as CC, and D as DD.

                         D = D + DD
         (That is, each of the four registers is incremented by
         the value it had before this block was started.)

         end /* of loop on i */

      Step 5. Output

         The message digest produced as output is A,B,C,D.  That is, we
         begin with the low-order byte of A, and end with the high-order
         byte of D.

         This completes the description of MD4.  A reference
         implementation in C is given in the Appendix.

4.  Extensions

   If more than 128 bits of output are required, then the following
   procedure is recommended to obtain a 256-bit output.  (There is no
   provision made for obtaining more than 256 bits.)

   Two copies of MD4 are run in parallel over the input.  The first copy
   is standard as described above.  The second copy is modified as
   follows.

   The initial state of the second copy is:
                    word A:    00 11 22 33
                    word B:    44 55 66 77
                    word C:    88 99 aa bb
                    word D:    cc dd ee ff

   The magic constants in rounds 2 and 3 for the second copy of MD4 are
   changed from sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to cuberoot(2) and cuberoot(3):

                                    Octal           Hex
            Round 2 constant        012050505746    50a28be6
            Round 3 constant        013423350444    5c4dd124

   Finally, after every 16-word block is processed (including the last
   block), the values of the A registers in the two copies are
   exchanged.

   The final message digest is obtaining by appending the result of the
   second copy of MD4 to the end of the result of the first copy of MD4.

5.  Summary

   The MD4 message digest algorithm is simple to implement, and provides
   a "fingerprint" or message digest of a message of arbitrary length.

   It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
   having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
   and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
   message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations.  The MD4
   algorithm has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses.  It is,
   however, a relatively new algorithm and further security analysis is
   of course justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this
   sort.  The level of security provided by MD4 should be sufficient for
   implementing very high security hybrid digital signature schemes
   based on MD4 and the RSA public-key cryptosystem.

 ** To use MD4:
 **   -- Include md4.h in your program
 **   -- Declare an MDstruct MD to hold the state of the digest
 **          computation.
 **   -- Initialize MD using MDbegin(&MD)

 **   -- For each full block (64 bytes) X you wish to process, call
 **          MDupdate(&MD,X,512)
 **      (512 is the number of bits in a full block.)
 **   -- For the last block (less than 64 bytes) you wish to process,
 **          MDupdate(&MD,X,n)
 **      where n is the number of bits in the partial block. A partial
 **      block terminates the computation, so every MD computation
 **      should terminate by processing a partial block, even if it
 **      has n = 0.
 **   -- The message digest is available in MD.buffer[0] ...
 **      MD.buffer[3].  (Least-significant byte of each word
 **      should be output first.)
 **   -- You can print out the digest using MDprint(&MD)
 */

 /* Implementation notes:
 ** This implementation assumes that ints are 32-bit quantities.
 ** If the machine stores the least-significant byte of an int in the
 ** least-addressed byte (e.g., VAX and 8086), then LOWBYTEFIRST
 ** should be set to TRUE.  Otherwise (e.g., SUNS), LOWBYTEFIRST
 ** should be set to FALSE.  Note that on machines with LOWBYTEFIRST
 ** FALSE the routine MDupdate modifies has a side-effect on its input
 ** array (the order of bytes in each word are reversed).  If this is
 ** undesired a call to MDreverse(X) can reverse the bytes of X back
 ** into order after each call to MDupdate.
