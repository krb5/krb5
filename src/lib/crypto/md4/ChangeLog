Fri Jul 7 16:13:28 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add t_cksum under unix only.
	* configure.in - Define MD4_K5BETA_COMPAT to select compatability for
		md4crypto.c.
	* md4crypto.c - Correct implementation of RSA-MD4-DES checksums.  Add
		ability to understand previous implementation and ability to
		generate these checksums when forced to.
		- Also add verification procedure for these checksums.
	* md4glue.c - Add verifier procedure.
	* rsa-md4.h - Add RSA_MD4_DES_CONFOUND_LENGTH, the length of the
		RSA-MD4-DES confounder per RFC1510.


Tue Jun 27 15:53:02 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* md4.c(Transform) - Add 'register' to scratch variable names.  Helps
		out compiler so that DEC native compilers can now optimize
		this module within our lifetimes.

Thu Jun 22 16:13:29 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

Fri Jun  9 19:18:17 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* md4crypto.c: Fix -Wall nits

		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Thu May 25 22:16:14 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for shared libraries.

Thu Apr 20 11:39:15 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

Thu Apr 13 15:49:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* *.[ch]: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.
        * *.h added FAR to pointers visible at to the world.
        * rsa-md4.h: __STDC__ condition also checks _WINDOWS

Thu Mar 16 21:19:55 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Tweak for Unix->MPW converter.
	(LDFLAGS):  Remove, conflicts with pre.in.
	(all):  Remove all-$(WHAT) stuff, generalize for all platforms.
	(t_mddriver):  Remove t_mddriver-$(WHAT) stuff, ditto.
	(check):  Use $(EXEEXT).

Tue Mar 14 17:24:57 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* md4crypto.c: removed method for DLL data since everything's
           going into one DLL.

Fri Mar 3 19:01:59 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* md4crypto.c: added a method to pull in a data structure 
           from outside a dll.

Thu Mar 2 17:53:35 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: changed LIBNAME for the PC

Tue Feb 28 00:19:06 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* rsa-md4.h:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Mon Feb 20 15:54:1 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: made to work for the PC
        * md4.c, md4crypt.c md4glue.c: added windows INTERFACE keyword
        * rsa-md4.h: added windows INTERFACE to prototypes

Thu Feb  2 03:00:41 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Handle $(srcdir) properly in -I options.

Wed Jan 25 20:08:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Add -I../des to pull in DES header file.
	* 
rsa-md4.h:  New include file, moved from include/krb5, since
	it's only used locally.
	* md4.c, md4crypto.c, md4driver.c, md4glue.c:  Replace <.../...>
	includes with "..."s.

Thu Oct 13 17:48:21 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

	* md4.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

Tue Oct  4 14:54:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* md4crypto.c:
	* md4glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.
