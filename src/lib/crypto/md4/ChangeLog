Wed Jun 12 00:10:42 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* md4.c
	* rsa-md4.h: Add #ifdef _WIN32 in places where we had #ifdef _MSDOS
	

Thu May 23 19:24:33 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (RUN_SETUP):  use KRB5_RUN_FLAGS

Tue May 21 22:33:12 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* md4crypto.c: Incorrrect size arguments were being passed causing
	decrypt integrity failures with the "fixed" md4 algorithm.  The old
	path was also fixed to better reflect the appropriate size variables
	even though the two in use were identical (if someone copied the
	code to make a new crypto system, they may spend a long time
	debugging because of the misuse of variables).
	[Tracked down by epeisach; audited by basch.]

Mon May 20 17:16:47 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* md4crypto.c, md4crypto.h: Change use of RSA_MD4_DES_CKSUM_LENGTH
 		to use OLD_RSA_MD4_DES_CKSUM_LENGTH and
 		NEW_RSA_MD4_DES_CKSUM_LENGTH, as appropriate.

Sat May 18 01:49:33 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* md4crypto.c: Define MD4_K5BETA_COMPAT and MD4_K5BETA_COMP_DEF so
 		that we continue doing things the wrong (broken) way.  All
 		hail backwards compatibility....  The code now generates
 		the old checksum, but it will verify both the old and the
 		correct checksum formats.

		Also fixed two bugs in the "correct" MD4_CRYPTO
		implementation; use a zero initialization vector, and
		calculate the confounder at the beginning of the message,
		not at the end.  

Tue May 14 19:31:58 1996  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* md4crypto.c md4glue.c:
		ensure the cksum content length is sufficient

	* md4glue.c - Add verifier procedure.
	* rsa-md4.h - Add RSA_MD4_DES_CONFOUND_LENGTH, the length of the
		RSA-MD4-DES confounder per RFC1510.


Tue Jun 27 15:53:02 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* md4.c(Transform) - Add 'register' to scratch variable names.  Helps
		out compiler so that DEC native compilers can now optimize
		this module within our lifetimes.

Thu Jun 22 16:13:29 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* md4.c: reverse sense of KRB5_PROVIDE_PROTOTYPES

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Tweak for Unix->MPW converter.
	(LDFLAGS):  Remove, conflicts with pre.in.
	(all):  Remove all-$(WHAT) stuff, generalize for all platforms.
	(t_mddriver):  Remove t_mddriver-$(WHAT) stuff, ditto.
	(check):  Use $(EXEEXT).

Tue Mar 14 17:24:57 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* md4crypto.c: removed method for DLL data since everything's
           going into one DLL.

Wed Jan 25 20:08:47 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS):  Add -I../des to pull in DES header file.
	* 
rsa-md4.h:  New include file, moved from include/krb5, since
	it's only used locally.
	* md4.c, md4crypto.c, md4driver.c, md4glue.c:  Replace <.../...>
	includes with "..."s.

Thu Oct 13 17:48:21 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Add support for the MDx test driver t_mddriver.
		Run t_mddriver on a "make check", to make sure we have a
		valid MD4 implementation.

	* md4.c (UL): Add the UL macro to control how unsigned long
		constants are compiled.  If we have an ANSI C environment,
		use the UL suffix to keep the compiler from warning about
		numbers that would overflow a signed long.

	* md4crypto.c:
	* md4glue.c: Added placeholder for magic number.
