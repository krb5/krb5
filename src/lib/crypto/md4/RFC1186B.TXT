1.  Executive Summary

   This note describes the MD4 message digest algorithm.  The algorithm
   takes as input an input message of arbitrary length and produces as
   output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.  It
   is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two
   messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message
   having a given prespecified target message digest.  The MD4 algorithm
   is thus ideal for digital signature applications, where a large file
   must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being signed with the
   RSA public-key cryptosystem.

   The MD4 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines.
   In addition, the MD4 algorithm does not require any large
   substitution tables; the algorithm can be coded quite compactly.

   The MD4 algorithm is being placed in the public domain for review and
   possible adoption as a standard.

   This RFC is a revision of the October 1990 RFC 1186.  The main
   difference is that the reference implementation of MD4 in the
   appendix is more portable.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   In this note a "word" is a 32-bit quantity and a byte is an 8-bit
   quantity.  A sequence of bits can be interpreted in a natural manner
   as a sequence of bytes, where each consecutive group of 8 bits is
   interpreted as a byte with the high-order (most significant) bit of
   each byte listed first.  Similarly, a sequence of bytes can be
   interpreted as a sequence of 32-bit words, where each consecutive
   group of 4 bytes is interpreted as a word with the low-order (least
   significant) byte given first.

   Let x_i denote "x sub i".  If the subscript is an expression, we
   surround it in braces, as in x_{i+1}.  Similarly, we use ^ for
   superscripts (exponentiation), so that x^i denotes x to the i-th
   power.

   Let the symbol "+" denote addition of words (i.e., modulo- 2^32
   addition).  Let X <<< s denote the 32-bit value obtained by
   circularly shifting (rotating) X left by s bit positions.  Let not(X)
   denote the bit-wise complement of X, and let X v Y denote the bit-
   wise OR of X and Y.  Let X xor Y denote the bit-wise XOR of X and Y,
   and let XY denote the bit-wise AND of X and Y.


3.  MD4 Algorithm Description

   We begin by supposing that we have a b-bit message as input, and that
   we wish to find its message digest.  Here b is an arbitrary
   nonnegative integer; b may be zero, it need not be a multiple of 8,
   and it may be arbitrarily large.  We imagine the bits of the message
   written down as follows:

                    m_0 m_1 ... m_{b-1} .

   The following five steps are performed to compute the message digest
   of the message.


3.1 Step 1. Append padding bits

   The message is "padded" (extended) so that its length (in bits) is
   congruent to 448, modulo 512.  That is, the message is extended so
   that it is just 64 bits shy of being a multiple of 512 bits long.
   Padding is always performed, even if the length of the message is
   already congruent to 448, modulo 512 (in which case 512 bits of
   padding are added).

   Padding is performed as follows: a single "1" bit is appended to the
   message, and then enough zero bits are appended so that the length in
   bits of the padded message becomes congruent to 448, modulo 512.




Rivest                                                          [Page 2]


RFC 1186B         The MD4 Message Digest Algorithm        9 January 1991



3.2 Step 2. Append length

   A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before the
   padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the previous
   step.  In the unlikely event that b is greater than 2^64, then only
   the low-order 64 bits of b are used.  (These bits are appended as two
   32-bit words and appended low-order word first in accordance with the
   previous conventions.)

   At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits and with
   b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits.  Equivalently,
   this message has a length that is an exact multiple of 16 (32-bit)
   words.  Let M[0 ... N-1] denote the words of the resulting message,
   where N is a multiple of 16.


3.3 Step 3. Initialize MD buffer

   A 4-word buffer (A,B,C,D) is used to compute the message digest.
   Here each of A,B,C,D are 32-bit registers.  These registers are
   initialized to the following values in hexadecimal, low-order bytes
   first):

                    word A: 01 23 45 67
                    word B: 89 ab cd ef
                    word C: fe dc ba 98
                    word D: 76 54 32 10


3.4 Step 4. Process message in 16-word blocks

   We first define three auxiliary functions that each take as input
   three 32-bit words and produce as output one 32-bit word.

                    f(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v not(X)Z
                    g(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v XZ v YZ
                    h(X,Y,Z)  =  X xor Y xor Z

   In each bit position f acts as a conditional: if x then y else z.
   (The function f could have been defined using + instead of v since XY
   and not(X)Z will never have 1's in the same bit position.)  In each
   bit position g acts as a majority function: if at least two of x, y,
   z are on, then g has a one in that bit position, else g has a zero.
   It is interesting to note that if the bits of X, Y, and Z are
   independent and unbiased, the each bit of f(X,Y,Z) will be
   independent and unbiased, and similarly each bit of g(X,Y,Z) will be
   independent and unbiased.  The function h is the bit-wise "xor" or
   "parity" function; it has properties similar to those of f and g.

   Do the following:

   For i = 0 to N/16-1 do:  /* process each 16-word block */
       For j = 0 to 15 do:  /* copy block i into X */
           Set X[j] to M[i*16+j].

         Do the following 16 operations:
             [A B C D 0  3]
             [D A B C 8  9]
             [C D A B 4  11]

             [C D A B 7  11]
             [B C D A 15 15]

         Then perform the following additions:
             A = A + AA
             B = B + BB
             C = C + CC
             D = D + DD

         (That is, each of the four registers is
         incremented by the value it had before
         this block was started.)

   end /* of loop on i */


3.5 Step 5. Output

   The message digest produced as output is A,B,C,D.  That is, we begin
   with the low-order byte of A, and end with the high-order byte of D.

   This completes the description of MD4.  A reference implementation in
   C is given in the Appendix.

RFC 1186B         The MD4 Message Digest Algorithm        9 January 1991



4.  Extensions

   If more than 128 bits of output are required, then the following
   procedure is recommended to obtain a 256-bit output.  (There is no
   provision made for obtaining more than 256 bits.)

   Two copies of MD4 are run in parallel over the input.  The first copy
   is standard as described above.  The second copy is modified as
   follows.

   The initial state of the second copy is:

                    word A: 00 11 22 33
                    word B: 44 55 66 77
                    word C: 88 99 aa bb
                    word D: cc dd ee ff

   The magic constants in rounds 2 and 3 for the second copy of MD4 are
   changed from sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to cuberoot(2) and cuberoot(3):

                           Octal             Hex
      Round 2 constant     012050505746      50a28be6
      Round 3 constant     013423350444      5c4dd124

   Finally, after every 16-word block is processed (including the last
   block), the values of the A registers in the two copies are
   exchanged.

   The final message digest is obtaining by appending the result of the
   second copy of MD4 to the end of the result of the first copy of MD4.


5.  Summary

   The MD4 message digest algorithm is simple to implement, and provides
   a "fingerprint" or message digest of a message of arbitrary length.
   It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
   having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
   and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
   message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations.  The MD4
   algorithm has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses.  It is,
   however, a relatively new algorithm and further security analysis is
   of course justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this
   sort.  The level of security provided by MD4 should be sufficient for
   implementing very high security hybrid digital signature schemes
   based on MD4 and the RSA public-key cryptosystem.

Security Considerations

   The level of security discussed in this memo by MD4 is considered to

APPENDIX - Reference Implementation

   This appendix contains the following files:

     md4.h -- header file for using MD4 implementation

     md4.c -- the source code for MD4 routines

     md4driver.c -- a sample "user" routine

     session -- sample results of running md4driver

   The implementation of MD4 given in this appendix differs from the one
   given in [1] and again in RFC 1186.  The main difference is that this
   version should compile and run correctly on more platforms than the
   other ones.  We have sacrificed performance for portability.  MD4
   speeds given in [1] and RFC 1186 are not necessarily the same as
   those one might obtain with this reference implementation.  However,
   it is not difficult to improve this implementation on particular
   platforms, an exercise left to the reader.  Following are some
   suggestions:

Rivest                                                          [Page 7]


RFC 1186B         The MD4 Message Digest Algorithm        9 January 1991



     1. Change MD4Block so that the context is not used at all if
        it is empty (mdi == 0) and 64 or more bytes remain (inLen
        >= 64). In other words, call Transform with inBuf in this
        case. (This requires that byte ordering is correct in
        inBuf.)

     2. Implement a procedure MD4BlockLong modeled after MD4Block
        where inBuf is UINT4 * instead of unsigned char *.
        MD4BlockLong would call Transform directly with 16 word
        blocks from inBuf.  Call this instead of MD4Block in
        general. This works well if you have an I/O procedure that
        can read long words from a file.

     3. On "little-endian" platforms where the lowest-address byte
        in a long word is the least significant (and there are no
        alignment restrictions), change MD4Block to call Transform
        directly with 64-byte blocks from inBuf (casted to a UINT4
        *).
