	braces in control structures.

2001-01-23  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rc_io.c (getdir): Subtract one from dirlen, since sizeof
	includes the terminating NUL character.  Avoid redundant path
	separators.

2000-04-28  Nalin Dahyabhai  <nalin@redhat.com>

	* rc_io.c (getdir): Don't check dirlen again, the call sites
	always do.  Fix dirlen calculation.

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

	* rc_io.c (krb5_rc_io_move): Workaround the fact that Windows has
		really poor emulation of POSIX functions such as rename.

		call!)  Fix supplied by Tom Sanfilippo (txn# 2184 in krb5dev)

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5
 		directory, since we've moved the configure.in tests in
 		this directory to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

Wed Feb 18 16:25:34 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up

        * Makefile.in: win32 build

	* rc_dfl.c, rc_dfl.h: Win32/DLL calling conventions for rcache

	* rc_io.c (krb5_rc_io_creat): In case of permission problems,
		don't unlink the old replay cache; make it a hard

		accidentally delete valuable data.

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_init): default lifespan to

Tue May 23 16:30:29 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_io.c: Rearrange #include files so that krb5.h gets included
		first, so that the debugging information can be more
		efficiently collapsed since the type numbers will be the
		same.

Mon May  1 23:10:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_recover): Fix memory leaks in this

		cache after we're done expunging it.

	* rc_io.c (krb5_rc_io_move): Make duplicate copies of the filename
		and the file descriptor (via malloc/strcpy and dup), so

        * rc_io.c: hack to get Microsoft C in std-c mode to allow
           low-level i/o routines. Probably not a permanent solution
           but keep until we decide on a better method.
        * rc_io.h: added 2 missing prototypes
        * rc_dfl.h: added 2 missing prototypes

		with the wrong type argument.  I have no idea how it was


Thu Sep  8 23:34:53 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@pinata)

	* rc_io.c: The variables dirlen and dir were declared global, and
		didn't need to be; changed to be static.

Sat Aug 20 00:09:37 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_expunge): name (t->name) was getting freed
	and we tried to use it.  Clear t->name to stop it from being
	freed, and then free it later.
