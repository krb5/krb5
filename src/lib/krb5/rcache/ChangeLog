Tue Aug 29 14:19:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in, .Sanitize, ser_rc.c - Add routines to serialize rcache.

Fri Aug  4 22:07:46 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* rc_conv.c (krb5_auth_to_rep): Add parens to shut up gcc -Wall

	* rc_io.c: Add parens to shut up gcc -Wall

	* rc_dfl.c: Add parens to shut up gcc -Wall

	* rc_base.c: Add parens to shut up gcc -Wall

Thu Jul 20 22:34:47 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* rc_dfl.c (rc_store): rename from store() to avoid conflict with
	dbm function of same name (and different prototype.)

Wed July  5 15:52:31 1995  James Mattly  <mattly@fusion.com>
	* rc_io.c added HAVE_MACSOCK_H, change open to THREEPARAMOPEN

Fri Jun  9 19:34:38 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Fri May 26 20:21:19 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries.

Tue May 23 16:30:29 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_io.c: Rearrange #include files so that krb5.h gets included
		first, so that the debugging information can be more
		efficiently collapsed since the type numbers will be the
		same.

Mon May  1 23:10:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_recover): Fix memory leaks in this
		function.  The krb5_donot_replay structure was not being
		freed properly.

Thu Apr 13 15:49:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* *.[ch]: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.

Fri Mar 31 16:44:34 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_expunage): Close the old, temporary reply
		cache after we're done expunging it.

	* rc_io.c (krb5_rc_io_move): Make duplicate copies of the filename
		and the file descriptor (via malloc/strcpy and dup), so
		that the old rc_io object can be cleanly closed without
		affecting the new rc_io object.

Fri Mar 17 20:27:41 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS):  Eliminate duplicate of config/pre.in.

Tue Mar 7 21:40:18 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: changed library name for the PC.

Tue Mar  7 19:54:32 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: take out ISODE_DEFS, ISODE_INCLUDE.

Tue Mar 7 12:33:29 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* rc_io.c: moved the enabling defines for low-level io, e.g. read,
           write, lseek, etc., out of here and into k5-config.h.

Thu Mar 2 11:55:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* rc_io.c: changed NEED_WINSOCK_H to NEED_SOCKETS

Wed Mar 1 12:03:30 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* *.c, *.h Added windows INTERFACE keyword
	* Makefile.in: made to work on the PC.
        * rc_dfl.c: Some int/long changes for the PC
        * rc_io.c: hack to get Microsoft C in std-c mode to allow
           low-level i/o routines. Probably not a permanent solution
           but keep until we decide on a better method.
        * rc_io.h: added 2 missing prototypes
        * rc_dfl.h: added 2 missing prototypes

Tue Feb 28 01:03:34 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* *.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Thu Dec 22 15:44:50 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Add test for uid_t.

Fri Oct 14 23:12:00 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in: Add ISODE_DEFS rule.

Mon Oct  3 19:32:59 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_def.c (krb5_rc_dfl_recover): krb5_rc_io_size was being called
		(still) with the wrong type argument.  Should have been &t->d.

Fri Sep 30 21:59:08 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_def.c (krb5_rc_dfl_ops): Add placeholder for magic number

Thu Sep 29 22:11:20 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_recover): krb5_rc_io_size was being called
		with the wrong type argument.  I have no idea how it was


Thu Sep  8 23:34:53 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@pinata)

	* rc_io.c: The variables dirlen and dir were declared global, and
		didn't need to be; changed to be static.

Sat Aug 20 00:09:37 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* rc_dfl.c (krb5_rc_dfl_expunge): name (t->name) was getting freed
	and we tried to use it.  Clear t->name to stop it from being
	freed, and then free it later.

Mon Jun 20 19:37:13 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* rc_base.h: #include <krb5/osconf.h> so that build works using	imake.
