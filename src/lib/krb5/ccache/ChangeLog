	* ccdefops.c:  Avoid includes with pathnames, since they don't work
	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
	convenience (where file doesn't build).
