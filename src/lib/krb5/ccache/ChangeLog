1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* ccdefops.c: Change the default ccache type under windows to be
		original FILE ccache type; this will get set to ccapi if
		the krbcc32.dll can be found.

Mon Feb  8 21:53:37 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Enable the ccapi directory for windows builds.

	* Makefile.in, ccdefops.c: Temporarily back out the ccapi ccache
		under Windows so we can make sure the rest of the krb5
		tree builds correctly under Windows.  (Note: I didn't
		revert lib/krb5/os/ccdefname.c, so setting KRB5_CC_NAME to
		FILE:C:\tmp\tkt is required to make things work.)

	* Makefile.in: Add windows build instructions to build CCache API
		Cache implementation.

		built by this makefile under Windows.

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5
 		directory, since we've moved the configure.in tests in
 		this directory to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

	* configure.in: Create the makefiles for all of the subdirectories
		and move all of the configure.in tests from the
		subdirectories into this configure.in.

	* configure.in: Update to new lib build procedure.

Thu Jun  6 00:04:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (all-windows): Don't pass $(LIBCMD) on the command
		line.  It's set in the windows.in prologue for all
		Makefiles anyway.

Wed Feb  7 00:23:18 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Folded in danw's changes to allow

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

	(CFLAGS):  Add -I options for file and stdio, to avoid paths in
	#include statements.
	(all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.
	* ccdefops.c:  Avoid includes with pathnames, since they don't work
	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
	convenience (where file doesn't build).
