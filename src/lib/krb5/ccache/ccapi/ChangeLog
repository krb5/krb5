2000-04-07  Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c (copyCCDataArrayToK5, copyCCDataArrayToK5): 
	* stdcc_util.c (dupCCtoK5, dupK5toCC): 

          memory was being allocated as   (sizeof(foo) * count + 1)
          instead of                      (sizeof(foo) * (count + 1))

2000-04-03  Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c (copyCCDataArrayToK5, copyCCDataArrayToK5): 
	* stdcc_util.c (dupCCtoK5, dupK5toCC): 

          Changed all references to the type UInt32 to unsigned int
          since UInt32 is not a standard type on Unix or Win32    

2000-03-24  Alexandra Ellwood  <lxs@mit.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c (copyCCDataArrayToK5, copyCCDataArrayToK5): 
		Modified to copy authdata as well... this code may have 
		bugs since I couldn't get a good case where authdata != NULL
	
	* stdcc_util.c (dupCCtoK5, dupK5toCC): 
		Added code to store times in localtime, not in kdc time.

2000-03-15  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_destroy): Do not mask KRB5_FCC_NOFILE error
	on destroy.

2000-02-10  Miro Jurisic <meeroh@mit.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c: Fixed lxs' fix

2000-02-10  Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c: Added +1 to strlen()'s so that the null terminator 
		will fit in the buffer.

2000-02-04  Scott McGuire  <smcguire@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_initialize):  Removed calls that destroyed
	   and recreated ccapi_data->NamedCache; instead close
	   and call create on it again.  (This makes sure the data stays
	   in the same cache the whole time so external pointers don't
	   get confused.)
	
1999-11-22  Miro Jurisic  <meeroh@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.h, stdcc_util.h: use CCache2.h under MacOS for CCAPI v2
	compatibility

1999-10-26  Wilfredo Sanchez  <tritan@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup.

1999-08-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_retrieve): Replace with a version that calls
	krb5_cc_retrieve_cred_default.

1999-08-05	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c (deep_free_cc_v5_creds):
		Added free(creds) so that the cc_creds gets freed when a 
		cred_union gets freed.  Before it was leaking memory.

		I searched the k5 sources for folks calling deep_free_cc_v5_creds 
		and my change seems to not break anyone else.
	
1999-08-03	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>
	
	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_destroy):
		Added code to free the krb5_ccache like krb5_stdcc_close does 
		so we don't leak memory.
		
1999-06-10  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.c (cache_changed): Use PostMessage instead of SendMessage
		so that we don't block.

1999-06-08  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* winccld.h:  Remove references to cc_*_instance functions.

Thu May 13 18:01:58 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winccld.c (krb5_win_ccdll_load): Register the FILE ccache type
		if we are using ccapi, so that we make sure the FILE
		ccache type will work if the user specifies it in an
		environment variable.

Mon May 10 15:24:36 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do win32 build in subdir.

Thu Apr  8 16:09:08 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winccld.c: Only compile this file on Windows (to avoid screwing
		up the Macintosh build).

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* winccld.c, winccld.h, stdcc.c: Add files to dynamically load
		krbcc32.dll, so that we can fall back and use the built-in
		file ccache type if krbcc32.dll doesn't exist.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)
