Fri Feb 27 18:03:33 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5

		tests to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

Wed Feb 18 16:19:40 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

		make comparison correct. (== has higher precedence than &)

Wed Jun 12 01:04:27 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* fcc-proto.h: Change use of PROTOTYPE to KRB5_PROTOTYPE.
		Change use of INTERFACE to KRB5_CALLCONV and KRB5_DLLIMP.

	* fcc-getnam.c: Change use of INTERFACE to KRB5_CALLCONV and
		KRB5_DLLIMP, since fcc_getname returns a char * and the
		old INTERFACE method bombs out when the return type
		contains an indirection.

Mon Jun 10 21:44:07 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* fcc_read.c:
	* fcc_ops.c: Change _WINDOWS to _MSDOS, and add check for _WIN32.

	* fcc-proto.h (krb5_fcc_skip_header): Added prototype (fix Windows
		lint flames).

Sat Feb 24 19:16:23 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* fcc_destry.c (krb5_fcc_destroy): For MS-DOS filesystems, you
		must close the file before unlinking it, otherwise the
		unlink() will fail.

Thu Feb 15 14:55:56 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* fcc_skip.c (krb5_fcc_skip_header): If version is not FVNO_4, do not

		being matched. 

Wed Jan 24 21:36:34 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* fcc_retrv.c (ktype_reasonable): Renamed ktype_match because it
        didn't really match enctypes.  Instead, it just determined whether
        they were something the TGS would likely return.  When I ask for
        an exact enctype match, I want an enctype match.
	(krb5_fcc_retrieve): Match keytype exactly if matching enctype.

Wed Jan 10 21:14:31 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* fcc.h (KRB5_FCC_DEFAULT_VNO): Remove KRB5_FCC_DEFAULT_VNO; now
		set in init_ctx.c.

	* fcc_maybe.c (krb5_fcc_open_file): 
	* fcc_gennew.c (krb5_fcc_generate_new): Use
		context->fcc_default_format to determine the credentials
		cache type.

	* fcc_read.c (krb5_fcc_read_keyblock): If reading in a version 3
		credentials cache, ignore the second enctype stored in the
		ccache; just read it into a dummy variable.

Thu Dec 21 18:28:09 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* fcc_maybe.c (krb5_fcc_open_file): In the case of
		FCC_OPEN_AND_ERASE, unlink the old filename, and then add
		the O_EXCL open flag, to prevent O_CREAT from following a
		symbolic link.
		(krb5_fcc_open_file): Use KRB5_CC_FORMAT as an error code
		instead of KRB5_CCACHE_BADVNO, when it's really a format
		error in the credentials cache file.

Fri Oct  6 22:03:16 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.

	 prototype problems.

	* fcc_maybe.c: included <stdio.h>

Tue Sep 05 22:58:52 1995

	* fcc.h : Add another KRB5_FCC_FVNO but don't up the default.
	* fcc_gennew.c, fcc_maybe.c : New version saves a length after 
		version for whatever we want to put into the ccache before 
		the first credential (like a time skew)
        * fcc_read.c, fcc_write.c : Remove krb5_enctype references, and 
		replace with krb5_keytype where appropriate
  
Tue Aug 29 13:36:00 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* fcc_reslv.c - Set magic number in successfully resolved ccache.

	* fcc_maybe.c (fcc_lock_file_posix): initialize lock_arg to a copy
 	of a static (thus zero) struct flock, to avoid panic'ing sunos
 	4.1.4.

Wed Jun 14 23:54:09 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fcc_errs.c (krb5_fcc_interpret): Add #ifdef around switch

	* fcc_init.c (krb5_fcc_initialize): Make sure the status return
	        from krb5_fcc_store_principal is reflected in the return
		status of krb5_fcc_initialize().

Tue May 23 16:28:07 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fcc_maybe.c: Rearrange #include files so that krb5.h gets
		included first, so that the debugging information can be
		more efficiently collapsed since the type numbers will be
		the same.

Tue May  9 16:23:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* fcc_close.c (krb5_fcc_close): Remove <malloc.h> as not all
		platforms have it and k5-int.h already takes care of
		malloc declarations.

	* *.[ch]: removed unneeded INTERFACE from non-api functions.

Tue Mar 21 19:14:49 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

           into a 32 bit integer fails miserbly on 16 bit machines. Fixed.
        * fcc_ops.c: added hooks to notify programs when the ccache changes.
           For windows, the code is taken from the K4 release, for other
           platforms it does nothing.
        * fcc_destroy.c, fcc_genn.c, fcc_init.c, fcc_store.c: added calls to
           the hook described for fcc_ops.c.

Tue Feb 28 00:35:55 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

Tue Feb 21 16:14:25 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	back to flock (if we have it.)

Fri Jan 27 00:49:36 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * Fix fcc_read.c (krb5_fcc_read_authdatum()) krb5_authdatatype
                is of type unsigned int and therefore shouldn't be the
                argument to krb5_fcc_read_ui_2(). 

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

		whatever version is marked as the default.

	* fcc_read.c (krb5_fcc_read_keyblock): Insert keyblock magic

		krb5_authdata structures.

Mon Oct 31 17:02:04 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fcc_maybe.c: Back out POSIX_FILE_LOCKS change.  (Should be
		depending on autoconf.h to supply this #define if
		necessary.) 

Thu Oct 13 17:23:42 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@maytag)

	* configure.in: Add ISODE_DEFS

	* fcc_retrv.c (srvname_match): Fix bug in srvname_match where so
	that the server realm is really ignored in the compare, like it's
	supposed to be.

Mon Jun 20 19:36:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* fcc.h: #include <krb5/osconf.h> so that build works using imake.
