	* fcc.h : Add another KRB5_FCC_FVNO but don't up the default.
	* fcc_gennew.c, fcc_maybe.c : New version saves a length after 
		version for whatever we want to put into the ccache before 
		the first credential (like a time skew)
        * fcc_read.c, fcc_write.c : Remove krb5_enctype references, and 
		replace with krb5_keytype where appropriate

	        from krb5_fcc_store_principal is reflected in the return
		status of krb5_fcc_initialize().

Fri Jun  9 19:30:01 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

Tue May 23 16:28:07 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fcc_maybe.c: Rearrange #include files so that krb5.h gets

		the same.

Tue May  9 16:23:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* fcc_close.c (krb5_fcc_close): Remove <malloc.h> as not all

           into a 32 bit integer fails miserbly on 16 bit machines. Fixed.
        * fcc_ops.c: added hooks to notify programs when the ccache changes.
           For windows, the code is taken from the K4 release, for other
           platforms it does nothing.

           the hook described for fcc_ops.c.

Tue Feb 21 16:14:25 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	back to flock (if we have it.)

Fri Jan 27 00:49:36 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * Fix fcc_read.c (krb5_fcc_read_authdatum()) krb5_authdatatype
                is of type unsigned int and therefore shouldn't be the
                argument to krb5_fcc_read_ui_2(). 

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines

Wed Dec  7 16:58:59 1994    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	(krb5_fcc_next_cred), fcc_store.c (krb5_fcc_store), fcc_read.c,
	fcc_write.c:  Changes to implement FCC format version #3, which
		is architecture independent, and includes the key
		encryption type information.

	* fcc_gennew.c (krb5_fcc_generate_new): Generate new ccaches using
		whatever version is marked as the default.

	* fcc_read.c (krb5_fcc_read_keyblock): Insert keyblock magic
		number and initialize etype value.  Also add magic numbers
		for the krb5_principal, krb5_data, krb5_address, and
		krb5_authdata structures.

Mon Oct 31 17:02:04 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* fcc_maybe.c: Back out POSIX_FILE_LOCKS change.  (Should be
		depending on autoconf.h to supply this #define if
		necessary.) 

Thu Oct 13 17:23:42 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@maytag)

	* configure.in: Add ISODE_DEFS

		with the credentials cache is freed after it is destroyed.

Thu Aug 18 16:33:33 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* fcc_retrv.c (srvname_match): Fix bug in srvname_match where so
	that the server realm is really ignored in the compare, like it's
	supposed to be.

Mon Jun 20 19:36:19 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* fcc.h: #include <krb5/osconf.h> so that build works using imake.
