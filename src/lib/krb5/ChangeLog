Mon Jun 26 17:36:53 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	isn't followed by a newline, as does fi, with certain shells.

Tue Nov  1 14:56:47 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in: Change the way libupdate works so that we use
		libkrb5.stamp to determine whether or not $arcmd needs to
		be rerun. 

	* Makefile.in:
