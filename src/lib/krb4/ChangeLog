1998-12-05  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* rd_svc_key.c (krb54_get_service_keyblock): New function which
		searches the appropaite krb5 keytab file for the key to be
		used by the krb4 library.

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): If the appropriate key cannot be found in
		the krb4 srvtab file, try calling krb54_get_service_keyblock.

	* decomp_tkt.c (dcmp_tkt_int): 
	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_mk_in_tkt_preauth): 
	* g_ad_tkt.c (get_ad_tkt): 
	* pkt_clen.c (pkt_clen): 
	* rd_err.c (krb_rd_err): 
	* rd_priv.c (krb_rd_priv): 
	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): 
	* rd_safe.c (krb_rd_safe): Use krb4_swab32 and krb4_swab16 instead
		of swap_u_long and swap_u_short.  The new byte swapping
		routines are faster and cleaner.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

	* configure.in: Remove KRB5_POSIX_LOCKS test.

	* win_store.c (krb__get_srvtabname): 
	* g_cnffile.c: Use krb5__krb4_context instead of init'ing and
		free'ing a krb5_context each time we need to read data
		from the configuration file.  We also define
		krb5__krb4_context in g_cnnfile.c, since it's a likely
		that any use of the krb4 library will pull in that file.

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): Use krb5_lock_file instead of trying to
		roll our own flock emulation.

Wed Aug 12 18:32:44 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rd_req.c (krb_set_key): Nuke the krb5_keyblock if it's set.
	(krb_set_key_krb5): New function to set a static krb5_keyblock for
	decryption purposes.
	(krb_clear_key_krb5): New function to clear the static
	krb5_keyblock if it's set.
	(krb_rd_req): Call decomp_ticket or decomp_tkt_krb5 as appropriate
	to the key type.

	* decomp_tkt.c (decomp_tkt_krb5): New wrapper to call
	dcmp_tkt_int.
	(decomp_ticket): Transform into wrapper to call dcmp_tkt_int.
	(dcmp_tkt_int): New internal function; use a krb5_keyblock to
	decrypt the ticket if present; else just use plain old C_Block.

	* cr_tkt.c (krb_create_ticket): Transform into a wrapper that
	calls krb_cr_tkt_int.
	(krb_cr_tkt_krb5): New wrapper to call krb_cr_tkt_int.
	(krb_cr_tkt_int): New internal function that potentially uses a
	krb5_keyblock to encrypt the ticket, or just a C_Block if the
	krb5_keyblock is not set.

Mon Aug 10 17:51:59 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* rd_svc_key.c (read_service_key): Don't call krb5_kt_close() if 
	krb5_kt_resolve() fails, so we don't segfault if the keytab name 
	is invalid.

Fri Aug  7 11:04:03 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rd_safe.c (krb_rd_safe): Fix up call to quad_cksum().

	* mk_safe.c (krb_mk_safe): Fix up call to quad_cksum().

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): Add call to getuid() to initialize me.

Thu Jul 30 13:13:30 1998  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@utwig.mesas.com>

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): s/,/= so getuid() actually gets called

Sun Jul 26 17:51:24 1998  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@utwig.mesas.com>

	* Makefile.in (LIBMAJOR): Bump libmajor

Thu Jul  9 19:35:01 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): Fixed a potential race condition in the opening 
	of v4 ticket files. tf_init() was calling lstat() followed by fopen().
	Now it calls fopen() and then calls lstat() and fstat() to check file 
	ownership and to check that it opened the file it thought it did. I 
	patched the shared memory code similarly, but since nothing uses it I
	don't have a good way to test it properly.
	
Wed Jun 24 03:09:28 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* mk_priv.c (krb_mk_priv): Fix up call to pcbc_encrypt().  By
 	taking the address of key, the 5th arg to pcbc_encrypt() was
 	actually a (char **) cast to a (C_Block *).  The reason for this
 	is that a C_Block (actually a des_cblock) is typedef'ed from a
 	char[8], which by being in the parameters of the definition of
 	krb_mk_priv() becomes of type (char *).  This means that using the
 	address operator on key resulted in a pointer to a pointer to a
 	char rather than a pointer to a des_cblock, which would have been
 	innocuous in this case because pcbc_encrypt() actually takes a
	(des_cblock *) as the 5th (ivec) argument.  The moral is to never
 	pass around naked arrays as function arguments; instead, pass
 	around pointers to arrays to avoid spontaneous conversions to
 	pointers sneaking up.  Note that CNS actually uses a (C_Block *)
	everywhere, and maybe we should as well.  *whew*

1998-05-08  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* stime.c (krb_stime): 
	* log.c (krb_new_log, krb_log): 
	* klog.c (klog): Print the year using 4 digits to avoid Y2K issues.

Tue Jan  6 17:11:28 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* in_tkt.c: Conditionalize use of macro do_seteuid, rather than
	redefining setreuid. [krb5-libs/521]

Sat Dec  6 22:17:28 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* dest_tkt.c: Add <string.h> for memset prototype.

Wed Nov 19 11:04:27 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): krb_err.h resides in the kerberosIV

Fri Oct 17 20:33:17 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* mac_time.c: Don't use the type KRB_INT32; it was leaked from
	des.h and was just the wrong answer.  Use long instead.  While
	we're at it, declare gettimeofdaynet_no_offset() as static because
	we have no real need to export it.

Thu Feb 20 23:27:39 1997  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* memcache.c: Just use malloc/free, since _nmalloc isn't on
		all versions of Windows.

Sun Feb 16 21:11:51 1997  Richard Basch  <basch@lehman.com>

	* Makefile.in: Win16/Win32 cleanup

Sun Nov 12 05:26:08 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* g_cnffile.c (krb__get_srvtabname): new function, looks up
	[libdefaults]krb4_srvtab for use where KEYFILE used to be.
	* g_cnffile.c (krb__v5_get_file): new function, looks up argument
	in [libdefaults] and tries to open it as a filename. Returns
	filehandle (or NULL, if fopen failed.)
	(krb__get_cnffile, krb__get_realmsfile): use krb__v5_get_file to
	look up "krb4_config" or "krb4_realms" respectively. Also add
	$KRB_REALMS override for realms file.

		files, instead of $(NETIO_OBJS)

	* tf_util.c (utimes): If __SVR4 is defined, #include <utime.h>,
		just as we do if __svr4__ is defined.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: If __SVR4 is defined, #include <sgtty.h>, just as
		we do if __svr4__ is defined.  (WARNING: This code still
		assumes that the BSD ioctl's are being supported, at least
		in compatibility mode.  We should really upgrade this code
		to use POSIX termios calls.)

Tue Jun 27 23:59:28 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): from_addr is an address, so use unsigned
	KRB4_32 instead of long.

Tue Jun 27 23:50:08 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* rd_safe.c (krb_rd_safe): use KRB4_32 for address comparison

        libraries


Fri Jun 16 11:15:45 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Change "./DONE" to "DONE" since we know how to make
		"DONE", hence a clean make won't get confused any more.
	* configure.in - Add shared library install target.


Thu Jun 15 18:07:24 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add definitions for shared library build rules.

	* cr_err_repl.c (cr_err_reply): Remove backward compatibility code
		for Kerberos V3 (!) which was causing problems for shared
		libraries.  Library code shouldn't try to reference global
		variables defined by the calling application!

Sun May 21 16:06:20 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* dest_tkt.c: If O_SYNC is not defined, define as 0.

	* configure.in: Check for stdlib.h

Thu May  4 10:03:22 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* put_svc_key.c (put_svc_key): remove spurious & in front of fkey
		(it's a char[] and takint address of it is redundant)

	* recvauth.c (krb_recvauth): remove spurious & in front of
		reference to kdata->session

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): remove spurious & in front of reference
		to ad->session

	* g_in_tkt.c(decrypt_tkt): remove spurious & in front of reference
		to key (it is a C_Block and taking address of it is
		redundant)

	* Makefile.in: new includes target to install krb_err.h in
		$(BUILDTOP)/include; includes depends on krb_err.h.
		Previously, it was attempting to install a header that had
		not yet been generated!

Tue May  2 09:30:50 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove krb_err.h from the include

	* configure.in: use AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(int) to set BITS16/BITS32.
	Use AC_TRY_RUN test to set MSBFIRST or LSBFIRST.

Tue Mar 28 09:19:23 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* send_to_kdc.c (send_to_kdc): only use secondary port if entry
	for primary doesn't have an explicit port number. Secondary port
	is still guessed to be 750. Also *don't* switch to the secondary
	port in general, since we might be using multiple realms.

Tue Feb 14 23:24:50 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* sendauth.c (krb_net_rd_sendauth):  Result is a Kerberos error
	code, not an errno.

Mon Feb  6 16:11:52 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* mac_store.c (DeleteServerMap):  When skipping a realm map, skip
	also the admin-flag byte; else walking the list of strings gets
	very confused. 

	* mac_stubs.c (kdriver):  Rename static variable to mac_stubs_kdriver,
	and export it to callers.
	(krb_get_ticket_for_service):  Circumvent MPW compiler bug that
	doesn't like array->memb inside a sizeof.  array[0].memb works.

Wed Feb 1 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  <jrivlin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Modify install-windows and clean-windows
	targets to install libraries into src/windows directory.

	_WINDOWS or macintosh.

	* g_krbhst.c (get_krbhst_default): New static function.
	(krb_get_krbhst): Use get_krbhst_default.

Fri Jan 20 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Changed libentry to debug in link command as
	libentry is no longer provided in the Visual C++ environment.
	Libentry is part of the library in Visual C++.  Debug is used
	purely to satisfy the syntax requirements of the link command.

Thu Jan 19 14:18:10 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* sendauth.c (krb_net_rd_sendauth): If the raw ticket length looks
	like the start of a warning from SunOS4 ld.so, just ignore the
	warning message, and look for the ticket after it.

Mon Jan 16 16:11:21 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* kuserok.c (kuserok):  Allow realm to be defaulted in the
	~/.klogin file; this simplfies DejaGnu testing of Kerberos.
	Fix bug that left kname_parse arguments uninitialized. 

Mon Jan 16 11:54:01 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* krb_err.et: Change KRBET_RD_APTIME message from ``delta_t too
	big'' to ``time is out of bounds.''

	* send_to_kdc.c: If POSIX, include <stdlib.h> instead of declaring
	malloc, calloc, and realloc.
	(cached_krb_udp_port): Make static.
	(send_to_kdc): If send_recv fails, and the kerberos port number
	used is from getservbyname, and is not 750, then try sending to
	port 750.

	* realmofhost.c (krb_realmofhost): If DO_REVERSE_RESOLVE is
	defined, canonicalize using gethostbyaddr.

Thu Jan 12 17:40:26 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* in_tkt.c (in_tkt): Set umask to 077 around creation of ticket
	file to ensure that it is created with write access, even if the
	user has a screwy umask value.

Thu Dec 29 23:59:49 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): factored out into
	krb_mk_in_tkt_preauth and krb_parse_in_tkt. This simplifies the
	SNK4 support on platforms that can't do callbacks from (shared)
	libraries.

Tue Dec 27 11:12:54 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): Rewrite switch statement to
	work when compiled by SCO 3.2v4 native C compiler.

Fri Dec 16 18:57:40 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* memcache.h: Use PROTOTYPE in declarations.
	* memcache.c: Rewrite function definitions to use Classic C
	parameter repetition rather than prototypes.

Thu Dec 15 18:23:37 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* memcache.c: Add typedefs and macro definitions to make this file
	compile on Unix as well as on Windows and the Mac.

	* fakeenv.c (_findenv, unsetenv): New functions, copied in from
	setenv.c.  The telnet server uses unsetenv.

Wed Nov 23 00:53:10 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* realmofhost.c (krb_realmofhost):  Allow arbitrary host
	names here, as in krb_get_phost, by canonicalizing the name
	into a fully qualified name using gethostbyname().  This
	has the effect of letting users not set the "local realm"
	config knob in more cases, since a name without a dot will
	be canonicalized and searched-for in the domain-to-realm
	database, rather than being assumed to be in the local realm.
	This problem was found by using unqualified hostnames in Wintel.

Wed Nov 23 00:26:17 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Clean up a few misleading error messages.

	* memcache.c (krb_get_tf_fullname):  Return NO_TKT_FIL if
	there are no tickets cached, just like from tf_util.c.
	* g_ad_tkt.c (get_ad_ticket):  If we try cross-realm 
	authentication, and it fails for lack of a key in the
	kerberos database, return AD_NOTGT ("No ticket-
	granting ticket") rather than KDC_PR_UNKNOWN ("Principal unknown").
	* krb_err.et, err_txt.c:  Update NO_TKT_FIL error message from
	"No ticket file (tf_util)" to "You have no tickets cached".

Thu Nov 17 12:31:27 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth): des_key_sched takes a des_cblock
	argument, not des_cblock *, so remove the cast.
	* rd_preauth.c (krb_rd_preauth): Likewise.

Wed Nov 16 22:13:28 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth): use des_key_sched instead; check
	its return value and fail if it fails.

	* in_tkt.c: Fix thinko in last change.

Fri Nov  4 12:05:57 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* in_tkt.c: Don't redefine setreuid if both hpux and __svr4__.

Fri Nov  4 02:10:58 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Make it build on MS-Windows again.

	* Makefile.in (NETIO_SRCS, NETIO_OBJS):  Break out, since these
	are required on MS-Windows and prohibited on Mac.
	(kerberos.dll):  Avoid line-length problems by copying 
	libraries from other directories and using very short names.

Tue Nov  1 15:47:44 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* dest_tkt.c: Include "krb.h" before <stdio.h>.

	match function definition.

Wed Oct 12 00:37:46 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	avoid multiple symbol definitions from krb_driver.h.  Needs further
	cleanup but not just before release.

Mon Oct 10 20:07:56 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* g_tkt_svc.c: (cacheInitialTicket) moved to new file Password.c

	* mac_glue.c:  Remove superfluous comment.

	* mac_stubs.c: Add code translating unix function call to mac
	driver control call for krb_get_tf_fullname

	* macsock.c: Remove superflous comment.

	* memcache.c: Remove unused #includes
	(krb_get_tf_realm) pass tktfile instead of blank to
	krb_get_tf_fullname.

	(get_tf_fullname): Because the symantics of GetNthCredentials
	(called by this routine) were changed to disable multiple named
	caches (for UNIX compatability) we have to replace the user name
	and instance it returns with the actual name and instance of the
	current cache, set by in_tkt and stored in file static global
	variables.

Mon Oct 10 13:37:34 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* mk_auth.c:  New file, created from sendauth.c.  Contains just

	driver call returning the Nth server mapping.
	* g_tkt_svc.c (CacheInitialTicket): If user name has changed save
	it.
	* memcache.c (krb_save_credentials): Fill in credential with
	currently authorized user name and instance expected by kerberos,

	change_session_count to change_cache.  This
	routine now maintains the lock on the library as well as sending
	ot broadcast messages to all to level windows when the cache
	changes. Also changed all calls to above routine throughout 
	memcache.c.

	* netwrite.c: use newly added SOCKET_READ and SOCKET_EINTR values
	to avoid use of read on Windows.  VMS dependencies moved to c-vms.h
	for uniformity with other platforms.

	* netread.c: use newly added SOCKET_READ and SOCKET_EINTR values
	to avoid use of read on Windows.  VMS dependencies moved to c-vms.h
	for uniformity with other platforms.
	
	* memcache.c: sname, sinst, srealm not stored if null pointers
	passed in.  This avoids problems found porting kpasssd.

Mon Aug 1 12:00:00 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* g_cnffil.c (krb__get_realmsfile): Added a routine to open
	the krb.realms file so that the routine can be overridden
	in Windows implementation with a routine which looks up
	the name of the realms file in the kerberos.ini file.

	* win_store.c: Created to parallel the Mac implementation.
	Routines in this file will provide access to the krb.conf,
	krb.realms files and other configuration information.

	allow the password not to be passed in, since there is code that
	does interesting things in the passwd_to_key routine.

	* g_svc_in_tkt.c (stub_key): don't assume C_Block is a struct; use
	memcpy instead of *.

	* log.c (krb_log): use char* instead of int for default args.

	valid Mac compatable error codes.  Got rid of warning messages for 
	pointer mismatches.

	* memcache.c (change_session_count): added routine and calls to it

	interface of "kerberos.h" by making calls to a device-driver
	using the hairy Mac interface of "krb_driver.h".  If you
	link with this, your Mac program can use a portable, clean
	interface to Kerberos.

	* g_tkt_svc.c:  New file, krb_get_ticket_for_service,
	an "easy application kerberizer", derived from kclient.

	* err_txt.c (krb_err_txt):  Avoid pointers to string initializers,
	since Think C can't cope with this in device drivers.
	(krb_get_err_table):  Remove interface, unused.

	* month_sname.c:  Avoid pointers to string initializers.
	* kname_parse.c:  Add FIXME comment about args.
	* mac_glue.c (read, write krb_ignore_ip_address):  Stub out.
	* macsock.c, memcache.c, sendauth.c:  Lint.  Think includes.

	* mac_store.h:  Eliminate static and obsolete stuff.
	* mac_store.c:  Update includes for Think.
	(gUserName):  Make static.

	* g_ad_tkt.c, kname_parse.c, memcache.c, mk_priv.c, mk_req.c,
	mk_safe.c, pkt_clen.c, rd_priv.c, rd_safe.c:  Remove uses of
	printf, by using DEB macro.

	* send_to_kdc.c:  Change to "krbports.h".
	(DEB):  Remove definition in favor of krb.h.
	(all calls to DEB):  Avoid passing stdout or stderr.

Thu Jun 30 22:58:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* *.c:  Remove remaining RCS ID strings.  Strings used as `char *'
	initializers upset Think C when building device drivers, since it
	doesn't have a good way to relocate the pointers when the driver
	is loaded.

	* *.c:  Use #include "..." rather than #include <...> for
	our own local include files, because Think C can't find them
	when enclosed in <...>.

Thu Jun 30 17:48:26 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* send_to_kdc.c (prog): Now const pointer to const.
	(timeout): Static var deleted.
	(send_recv): Use a local timeout structure instead, reinitialized
	before each use, in case select modifies its value.

	to possibly release storage used by krb_mk_preauth.

	* g_svc_in_tkt.c (krb_get_svc_in_tkt_preauth): use
	krb_free_preauth to possibly release storage used by krb_mk_preauth.

Wed Jun 22 19:33:21 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* put_svc_key.c: USE_UNISTD_H to get SEEK_CUR if neccessary.

	* sendauth.c (krb_mk_auth): Don't call memset with BUFSIZ, since
	the field in question is only MAX_KTXT_LEN bytes long.

	* in_tkt.c, mk_priv.c, mk_safe.c, pkt_cipher.c, pkt_clen.c,
	rd_err.c, rd_priv.c, rd_safe.c, tf_util.c: Include string.h.

Wed Jun 22 15:11:35 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	names.  Pull RCS crud.

Tue Jun 21 00:20:20 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (all):  First rule in file just calls all-really.
	(all-really):  Call $(ALL_WHAT) after it's been set.
	* memcache.c:  Remove typedef kludges to
	../../include/mt-windows.h.  Add Size.  WINDOWS -> _WINDOWS.

	Make DES library independent of krb library.

	* unix_glue.c, mac_glue.c, win_glue.c:  Remove time-handling

	* send_to_kdc.c (send_recv):  Use SOCKET_NFDS as first arg to
	select().

	under #if 0.
	* cr_ciph.c, cr_tkt.c, decomp_tkt.c, g_ad_tkt.c, mac_store.c,
	mk_req.c, mk_safe.c: Lint.

Fri Jun 17 02:02:00 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* DNR.c:  New file of MacTCP interface code.
	* macsock.c:  To avoid using StreamPtr in <macsock.h>, declare
	fStream as unsigned long.  Cast it whenever we need it.  This
	removes the need to include MacTCP header files in <macsock.h>.
	* macsock.c, mac_glue.c:  Eliminate inclusion of "mac_glue.h".
	* mac_glue.h:  Remove.

Thu Jun 16 17:30:04 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (unixmac):  New target.
	* g_in_tkt.c:  MPW complains about types without a cast.
	* mac_glue.c:  Pull networking code out into macsock.c.
	(krb_get_phost):  Pull this; use ordinary common version.
	(krb_start_session, krb_end_session):  Add.
	* mac_store.c (gUserName):  Add definition.
	Move static declarations above where they're needed.
	(krb_realmofhost):  Return null pointer, not KFAILURE.
	* macsock.c:  New file, implements socket abstraction for UDP.
	* memcache.c: Update header file handling.  FIXME, works on Mac,
	not on Windows too.

	* mac_glue.h:  New (was called MacMachineDependencies.h in
	an earlier incarnation).
	* mac_glue.c:  Add code for time zone and Domain Name
	Service resolution.
	* mac_store.c:  Eliminate credential storage, leaving just
	configuration storage.  Initialize the store whenever a
	high-level routine is called and we haven't initialized.
	Return result from init_store, so callers can return
	KFAILURE if we can't read the config data.
	* mac_store.h:  Pull credential storage (now in memcache.h).
	* unix_glue.c (krb_start_session, krb_end_session,
	krb_get_default_user):  Provide dummy ones on Unix.

Thu Jun  9 00:47:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SRCS, OBJS):  Move cr_death_pkt.c and kparse.c
	to SERVER_SRCS and SERVER_OBJS.
	(DELIVERABLES, INSTALL_DELIVERABLES):  Replace with ALL_WHAT
	and INSTALL_WHAT, which actually work.
	(all-unix):  Main rule for building on Unix now.
	(clean):  Consolidate `make clean' entries so it actually works.

Wed Jun  8 23:47:30 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Further DLL support for Windows, plus, make previous
	changes work on Unix again.

	* memcache.c:  New file implements ticket cacheing in RAM.
	* memcache.h:  Interface for memcache.c.

	* win_glue.c: Remove stub interfaces for in_tkt, save_credentials,
	krb_save_credentials, krb_get_cred, dest_tkt, krb_get_tf_realm.

	Declare and use new key_proc_type and decrypt_tkt_type
	typedefs for pointers to function prototypes.
	(krb_get_in_tkt):  Move after krb_get_in_tkt_preauth.
	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth):  Declare and use key_proc_type.

	* dest_tkt.c (dest_tkt), in_tkt.c (in_tkt), g_tf_fname.c
	(krb_get_tf_fullname): If ticket cache selector is null, use
	default cache.  (Cache selector used to be the result of
	tkt_string; now tkt_string is called when it is null.)

	* send_to_kdc.c:  Replace all debug printf's with calls to
	the DEB macro, which is a no-op unless #define DEBUG.
	Insert #ifdef DEBUG where that is inconvenient.  (DLL libc
	doesn't seem to have printf.)  Lint.

	* g_krbrlm.c (krb_get_lrealm):  Declare as INTERFACE.
	Break out KRB_CONF into a static variable so we can debug it
	easier.
	
	* g_pw_in_tkt.c (krb_get_pw_in_tkt):  Declare as INTERFACE.
	Give an explicit error if the supplied password is null;
	this forces the caller to supply us one, rather than relying
	on a Kerberos library routine to interact with the user.  Lint.
	(passwd_to_key):  Make extern.  Don't call *_read_password.
	(krb_get_pw_in_tkt_preauth):  Give error for null password.	
	(placebo_read_password):  Add FIXME comment.

	(all-windows, install-windows):  New targets for MS-Windows.

	* kerberos.def:  New file defines the Kerberos DLL interface.

	* winsock.def:  New file defines the WinSock DLL interface that
	we rely upon.  This file is from FTP:
	//sunsite.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/winsock-1.1
	except that we made all the routine names uppercase, to match what
	MicroSoft C does when you declare an interface routine PASCAL
	(like all these routines).

	* err_txt.c (krb_get_err_table, krb_get_err_text):  New
	functions for DLL access to the error table.

	* g_admhst.c, g_cred.c, g_krbhst.c, g_phost.c, g_svc_in_tkt.c,
	kname_parse.c, mk_err.c, mk_priv.c, mk_req.c, mk_safe.c, rd_err.c,
	rd_priv.c, rd_req.c, rd_safe.c, realmofhost.c, recvauth.c,
	sendauth.c: Add INTERFACE declaration to definitions of functions
	that are exported via the DLL interface.

	* win_glue.c (win_time_gmt_unixsec):  Use static storage for
	_ftime() arg, since it takes a near pointer and can't point to
	stack storage when SS!=DS.
	(in_tkt, save_credentials, krb_save_credentials, krb_get_cred,
	dest_tkt, krb_get_tf_realm, krb_set_tkt_string,
	krb_ignore_ip_address):  Dummy routines for now.
	(LibMain, WEP):  No-op routines required for DLL initialization.
	(krb_start_session, krb_end_session): No-op routines required for
	Kerberos Mac interface compatability.

	* save_creds.c (krb_save_credentials):  Add new interface function
	to replace save_credentials, which isn't well enough named to
	export as part of the Kerberos interface.

	* kname_parse.c, kparse.c, rd_safe.c, send_to_kdc.c:  Move
	printf's under #ifdef DEBUG since printf is not usually available
	in MS-Windows.  Change exit()'s under "can't happen" conditions to
	return statements.

	* g_krbhst.c:  Clean up #ifdef'd braces so they match up.
	* sendauth.c:  Remove unused "extern int errno;".

	* mk_err.c, save_creds.c:  Remove RCS crud.
	* ren.msg:  Add rd_preauth.c and mk_preauth.c to DOS rename table.

Wed May 25 09:17:06 1994  D V Henkel-Wallace  (gumby@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: when read_password.c was inserted whole into this
	file, des.h and conf.h were #include'ed, which causes circularity
	problems.  #include's removed; they weren't needed anyway.

Tue May 24 00:55:30 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* sendauth.c:  Break up into separately callable functions to
	avoid pushing binary data down a socket supposedly controlled
	by the kerberos library's caller.
	(krb_mk_auth):  New; builds a packet and returns it to you.
	(krb_net_rd_sendauth):  Reads a packet from the net.
	(krb_check_auth):  Checks an incoming response for validity.
	FIXME:  ATHENA_COMPAT code in here is now broken.  Remove it?
	FIXME:  Break up into separate files so that the non file
	descriptor part can be included on Mac.

	* g_admhst.c, mk_req.c:  Pull RCS crud.

	* mk_req.c:  Allow the realm argument to be defaulted with a null
	pointer.  This makes it suitable for building krb_sendauth
	messages directly.

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): If argument is null, call tkt_string to
	select a ticket cache.  See also ../../include/krb-sed.h, where
	the default argument was changed to be null.

	* send_to_kdc.c (MAX_HSTNM):  Eliminate only use of this obsolete
	define; use MAXHOSTNAMELEN which is set properly in each system.

	* fakeenv.c:  Update copyright notice (it's now public domain,
	freed by Cygnus Support, for whom the work was done for hire).

Mon May 23 00:19:46 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* rd_svc_key.c (get_service_key): new function. Same as original
	read_service_key except that it takes argument kvno by reference,
	so the caller can figure out what key actually matched. Also
	defaults to KEYFILE if file argument is NULL (instead of just
	calling open with that value.) Also defaults to current realm if
	realm argument not passed in.
	(read_service_key): now calls get_service_key.

	* rd_safe.c (krb_rd_safe): check krb_ignore_ip_address before
	deciding to fail on an IP address check.
	(krb_rd_safe): remove "direction checking" code which doesn't
	actually help, and can interfere if IP addresses are optional.

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): check krb_ignore_ip_address before
	deciding to fail on an IP address check; move test to end of
	function as well (to provide more information value in the
	RD_AP_BADD error return.)

	* rd_req.c: define (allocate) krb_ignore_ip_address.

	* rd_priv.c (krb_rd_priv): check global variable
	krb_ignore_ip_address before deciding to fail on an IP address
	check.
	(krb_rd_priv): remove "direction checking" code which doesn't
	actually help, and can interfere if IP addresses are optional.

	* netread.c (krb_net_read): use socket_read under VMS, assuming
	MultiNet. 

	* netwrite.c (krb_net_write): use socket_write under VMS, assuming
	MultiNet. 

	* mk_priv.c (krb_mk_priv): If private_msg_ver isn't set yet, use
	the expected version (KRB_PROT_VERSION) instead.

	* Makefile.in (SRCS, OBJS): added mk_preauth, rd_preauth.

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): New function. Supports
	simple preauthentication by appending data to the initial packet.
	Demonstration hooks only.

	* g_svc_in_tkt.c (krb_get_svc_in_tkt_preauth): New function.
	Preauthentication support for initial tickets for servers.
	(krb_svc_init): New function. An interface to krb_get_svc_in_tkt
	that is provided by DEC's dss-kerberos, added here for
	compatibility.
	(krb_svc_init_preauth): preauthentication version of krb_svc_init.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c	(krb_get_pw_in_tkt_preauth): New function.
	Higher level interface to g_in_tkt for users.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: in NOENCRYPTION section, pull in <sgtty.h>
	under __svr4__ so the ioctls work under Solaris.

Sat May 21 04:02:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (c-libkrb.${LIBEXT}):  Typos, do .o->.obj.
	* gethostname.c:  Simplify to call GETHOSTNAME macro.
	* stime.c:  Arg is *time, not time.  Oops.  Also simplify.
	* win_glue.c:  Support CONVERT_TIME_EPOCH and make it work
	for the odd epoch on MSC 7.0.
	(win_socket_initialize):  New routine implements SOCKET_INITIALIZE.
	(in_tkt, save_credentials, dest_tkt):  Stubs to link kinit with.

	First FAR crap in our clean sources (sigh).

	* win_glue.c (far_fputs):  Print a far string returned by WinSock.
	* ad_print.c:  Handle FAR pointer from inet_ntoa.
	* g_phost.c:  Handle FAR pointer returned by gethostby*.
	
	* send_to_kdc.c: Convert to WinSock plus local macros that make
	compatability easier.  Initialize and terminate WinSock access
	each time we are called.  Handle FAR pointer from get*by* and
	inet_ntoa.  Bind the datagram socket before using it, to get
	beyond a bug in FTP Software's WinSock libraries.  Improve debug
	messages.

Thu May 19 22:57:13 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	More Windows support.

	(SERVER_KRB_{SRCS,OBJS}):  Rename from SERVERSIDE*.
	(ARCHIVEARGS):  Implement MSC LIB support.

	down so they can override the various Makefile macros.
	(libkrb.$(LIBEXT)):  Avoid keeping a .bak file.  Use ARCHIVEARGS.
	(unixdos):  New target for things that have to run on Unix
	after configuring for DOS.  (FIXME, make these work on DOS.)

	* g_ad_tkt.c, rd_safe.c, rd_req.c, rd_priv.c, mk_safe.c, mk_req.c:
	Remove <sys/time.h>.  Use TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC and clean up datatype

	conditionals, which should be handled by changing CLOCK_SKEW in
	960-specific config files.
	* mk_priv.c:  Rename TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC_MS to TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC_US.

	* cr_tkt.c, debug.c, mk_safe.c, rd_err.c, rd_safe.c, recvauth.c,
	sendauth.c:  Pull RCS crud. 
	* rd_safe.c, sendauth.c:  Lint.
	* strcasecmp.c:  Remove <sys/types.h> and change the few
	occurrances of u_foo types to `unsigned foo'.  Pull SCCS crud(!).

Sun May  8 19:24:08 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* add_tkt.c, ext_tkt.c:  Remove, unused.  As its comments say:
	This routine is now obsolete.  It used to be possible to request
	more than one ticket at a time from the authentication server, and
	it looks like this routine was used by the server to package the
	tickets to be returned to the client.

	* g_request.c:  Remove, unused.  Its comments:
	This procedure is obsolete.  It is used in the kerberos_slave
	code for Version 3 tickets.

	* getopt.c:  Remove, unused.
	* Makefile.in:  Remove unused files.

Sat May  7 13:44:20 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* krbglue.c:  Remove, unused.  Mark Eichin says:
	krbglue, if I recall correctly, was backwards compatibility code so
	that programs that were written with V3 could be relinked with V4
	without recompiling. The Zephyr code used it at one point, though I
	doubt it does anymore. It's probably sufficient to note that in the
	cvs log when you delete it.

	* krbglue.c, recvauth.c, sendauth.c:  Lint.

Fri May  6 21:11:10 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* ren-cyg.sh, ren-pc.sh, ren-pl10.sh, ren.msg.sh, ren2dos,
	ren2long.sh sed-cyg.sh, ren-pc.bat, sed-pc.sh:  Update for final
	DOS renaming.

Fri May  6 18:32:11 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* rd_priv.c, mk_priv.c, rd_safe.c, mk_safe.c:  Rename include
	file "lsb_addr_comp.h" to "lsb_addr_cmp.h" for DOS/SYSV.

Fri May  6 02:10:50 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* krbglue.c: Move Kerberos function prototypes to ../include/krb.h.
	Yank RCS.  Lint.
	* mk_priv.c (krb_mk_priv), rd_priv.c (krb_rd_priv):  Lint.  Yank RCS.

Thu May  5 12:49:34 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* decomp_tkt.c: Remove need for <sys/file.h> under KRB_CRYPT_DEBUG
	by using stdio.  Call krb_log, not log.  Lint.  Remove RCS ID's.

	* g_tf_realm.c:  Lint.

Tue Apr 26 20:54:29 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	Massive file renaming for DOS compatability.

	* ren.msg, ren-cyg.sh, sed-cyg.sh:  New files.

	* Imakefile, Makefile.in:  File names edited throughout.

	* add_ticket.c, cr_auth_reply.c, cr_err_reply.c, create_ciph.c,
	create_ticket.c, debug_decl.c, decomp_ticket.c, extract_tkt.c,
	get_ad_tkt.c, get_admhst.c, get_cred.c, get_in_tkt.c, get_krbhst.c,
	get_krbrlm.c, get_phost.c, get_pw_tkt.c, get_request.c, get_svc_in.c,
	get_tf_fname.c, get_tf_realm.c, getrealm.c, k_gethostname.c,
	krb_err_txt.c, krb_get_in.c, read_svc_key.c, util.c:  Renamed.

	* ad_print.c, add_tkt.c, cr_auth_repl.c, cr_ciph.c, cr_err_repl.c,
	cr_tkt.c, debug.c, decomp_tkt.c, err_txt.c, ext_tkt.c, g_ad_tkt.c,
	g_admhst.c, g_cred.c, g_in_tkt.c, g_krbhst.c, g_krbrlm.c,
	g_phost.c, g_pw_in_tkt.c, g_pw_tkt.c, g_request.c, g_svc_in_tkt.c,
	g_tf_fname.c, g_tf_realm.c, gethostname.c, rd_svc_key.c,
	realmofhost.c:  Same files, renamed.

Sun Jan 30 17:28:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* getrealm.c (krb_realmofhost): Rearrange loop so that strcasecmp
	is called only once for domains listed in krb.conf, and exiting
	function is cleaner.
