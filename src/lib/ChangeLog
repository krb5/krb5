Tue Oct 10 21:45:51 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Added the "/nod" option to the gssapi.dll and
		libkrb5.dll linker commands.  This prevents the linker
		from searching the llibcew.lib library for some externals
		which are already in ldllcew.lib.  This is what we want
		since we are building a DLL. Without the "/nod" option we
		get a bunch of duplicate definitions.

Fri Sep 29 14:19:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (CLEANLIBS): Clean up make clean procedures.  The
		files to be removed are defined in CLEANLIBS, for both the
		Unix and Mac platforms.

Mon Sep 25 16:26:53 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

	* configure.in: Remove custom MAKE_SUBDIRS line with the
		standard DO_SUBDIRS rule, which works now that we're
		revamping how the foo-$(WHAT) system works.

Wed Jul 12 12:25:15 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Temporarily add --with-kdb4 to select building of
		kdb4 directory.  Default is disabled.


Thu Jun 15 17:57:26 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Do not build K4 directories if we're not supposed to.
		Remove LinkFile() logic and put it in each subdirectory.

Wed Jun 14 07:36:46 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove shared library symlinks

	* configure.in: Create symlinks to libdes425.a
		If shared libraries enabled, symlink the .so libraries

Fri Jun  9 18:53:30 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Sun Jun  4 20:50:31 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Change order of library building to allow for
		proper dependency order for shared libraries.

Tue May 23 22:25:03 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean-unix): Remove symlinks to libkrb4.a and
		libkdb4.a. 

Tue May  2 21:39:26 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: nuke spurious whitespace from blank line


Fri Apr 28 15:32:54 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	Add kadm to list of directories to be built.

Thu Apr 27 14:31:01 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: make links for libkrb4 and libkdb4.

Wed Apr 27 11:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: need to include profile.lib in the DLL.

Thu Apr 27 13:32:35 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: add kdb4 directory.

Thu Apr 27 11:54:19 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: add krb4 directory (still needs to be
	conditionalized on unix)

Thu Apr 20 12:16:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* win_glue.c: include k5-int.h instead of krb5.h.

Mon Apr 17 17:47:07 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: forgot about the rule to make gssapi.lib on the PC.

Wed Apr 12 14:40:30 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Move dependency for all-$WHAT back
		into Makefile.in so that the Windows port can pick up the
		line (since it doesn't use configure).  Instead, change
		the name of target which causes the subdirectories to be
		built under Unix, and make that a dependency for all-unix.
		Gross, but this should fix things for both DOS and Windows.

Thu Apr 13 16:56:50 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in, libkrb5.def, gssapi.def (new): 
           Spec says we need a gssapi.dll & gssapi.lib.
        * Makefile.in: re-inserted make-$(ALL) rule.

Wed Apr 5 16:27:53 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

Fri Mar 31 16:15:59 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Move the dependency which causes
		all-$(WHAT) to be built so that it occurs after the "make
		all" subdirectories rule.

Thu Mar 30 15:46:23 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* libkrb5.def: removed the masses of exported files, leaving just
	   the ones needed by telnet and cns plus the gssapi ones.

Tue Mar 28 18:26:01 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (clean-mac):  Add.
	* configure.in (LinkFile's):  Put `./' on libraries to ease Mac
	translation.
	(AppendRule all-unix):  Rename from AppendRule all.

Thu Mar 23 14:26:35 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	   and added gssapi to libkrb5 dll.
	* libkrb5.def: added gssapi routines to the export section.

Thu Mar 16 15:00:00 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: fixed up a typo.

Wed Mar 15 22:45:33 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

Mon Oct  3 23:38:03 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)
